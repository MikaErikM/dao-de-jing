        "1": "Tao that can be expressed is not Everlasting Tao.\nThe name that can be named is not the Everlasting Name.\nThe Name, in its inner aspect, is Life-Spring of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Name, in its outer aspect, is Mother of all created things.\nTherefore:\nTo perceive the mystery of Life, desire always to reach the innermost.\nTo perceive the limitations of things, desire always to posses them.\nThese two aspects of Life are One.\nIn their out-come they become different in Name but in their depth they are One.\nIn a depth, still deeper yet, is the Door of many mysteries.",
        "2": "All men know the existence of beauty,\nBeauty, cleft asunder, is ugliness.\nAll men know the existence of Love.\nLove, cleft asunder, is hatred.\nTherefore \"possessions\" and \"Inner Life\" interdepend in life.\nDifficult and easy interdepend in completeness.\nLong and short interdepend in form.\nHigh and low interdepend in alternation.\nTone and voice interdepend in harmony.\nBefore and after interdepend in sequence.\nThat is why the self-controlled man\nmakes it his business to dwell in the Inner Life;\nhe teaches not by words, but by actions;\nhe brings all beings into action, he does not refuse them;\nhe gives them life, but does not possess them;\nhe acts, but does not look for reward;\nhe works out perfectness, but claims no credit.\nThe Master, indeed, rests not on rewards.\nThat is why he passes not away.",
        "3": "Exalt not men, so that the people may not fight.\nPrize not rare objects, so that the people may not steal.\nLook not on desirable things, so that the people's hearts be not troubled.\nThat is why the self-controlled man governs by stilling the emotions, by quieting thought, by mastering the will, by increasing strength.\nHe always teaches the people to know the Inner Life, to desire the Inner Life.\nHe teaches the Masters of knowledge to cease from activity, to act through activity of the Inner Life; then Inner Life will govern all.",
        "4": "Tao is infinite.\nIf we use It, we find It inexhaustible,\nDeep!\nIt appears to be Ancestor of all things.\nIt rounds our angles. It unravels our difficulties. It harmonizes our Light. It brings our atoms into Unity.\nPure!\nIt appears to be everlasting in principle.\nI do not know whose Son It is,\nIt existed before God was manifest in Form.",
        "5": "Heaven and earth are impartial, they regard all creatures as sacred.\nThe self-controlled man is impartial, he regards all people as sacred.\nThe space between Heaven and Earth is like a bellows.\nEmptied, it loses not power,\nMoved, it sends forth more and more wind.\nMany words lead to exhaustion.\nBe not thus; keep to thy center.",
        "6": "The Spirit of the Valley dies not, it is called Mother-substance of the Deep.\nThe Door of Mother-substance of the Deep is called the Root of Heaven and Earth.\nContinuously, continuously,\nIt nourishes and preserves.\nUse it,\nThy strength shall not fail.",
        "7": "Heaven and Earth can endure long.\nIf Heaven and Earth endure long,\nIt is because they do not live for self,\nTherefore they can long endure.\nThat is why the self-controlled man puts himself last,\nYet he is found in the foremost place.\nHe regards his body as outside of himself,\nYet his body is preserved.\nIs it not that his chief interest is in the Inner Life?\nTherefore he can perfect his chief interest.",
        "8": "Heavenly Love is like water.\nWater blesses all things,\nIt does not hurt them.\nIt loves the lowly place that men dislike,\nTherefore it comes very near to Tao.\nThe Master loves to dwell upon the earth.\nIn his heart he loves Infinity,\nIn his benevolence he loves giving,\nIn his words he loves sincerity,\nIn his government he loves peace,\nIn his business affairs he loves ability,\nIn his movements he loves punctuality.\nThe Master, indeed, does not fight,\nTherefore his Inner Life increases.",
        "9": "Let Heavenly Love fill you and overflow in you,\nNot according to your measure of fulness.\nProve it, probe deeply into it,\nIt shall not long withstand you.\nYou may fill a place with gold and precious stones,\nYou will not be able to guard them.\nYou may be weighted with honours and become proud.\nMisfortune then will come to your Self.\nYou may accomplish great deeds and acquire fame,\nRetire yourself;\nThis is Heavenly Tao.",
        "10": "Bring soul and spirit into unity, they will become welded in the Inner Life.\nConquer vital force until it yields to you, you will become as a new-born child.\nPurify the channels of deep perception, you will dwell safely in the Inner Life.\nGovern a kingdom by loving the people, they will learn to act from the Inner Life.\nOpen and shut the doors of heaven, you will have repose of mind in active life.\nLet your purity shine forth in all directions, men will see that you have an Inner Life.\nGive it birth, nourish it,\nGive it birth, but do not seek to possess.\nAct but do not appropriate.\nEndure but do not rule.\nThat is called profound Teh.",
        "11": "Thirty spokes surround one nave, the usefulness of the wheel is always in that empty innermost.\nYou fashion clay to make a bowl, the usefulness of the bowl is always in that empty innermost.\nYou cut out doors and windows to make a house, their usefulness to a house is always in their empty space.\nTherefore profit comes from external form, but usefulness comes from the empty innermost.",
        "12": "The five colours blind the eyes of man.\nThe five musical notes deafen the ears of man.\nThe five flavours dull the taste of man.\nViolent running and hunting disturb the emotions of man.\nGreed for rare objects is hurtful to the actions of man.\nThat is why the self-controlled man occupies himself with the unseen, he does not occupy himself with the things visible, he puts away the latter and seeks the former.",
        "13": "Dread glory as you dread shame.\nPrize great calamity as you prize your body.\nWhat does this mean:\n\"Dread glory as you dread shame\"?\nGlory comes from below.\nObtain it, you are afraid of shame;\nLose it, you are still afraid of shame.\nThat is why it is said;\n\"Dread glory as you dread shame.\"\nWhat does this mean:\n\"Prize great calamity as you prize your own body\"?\nWe who meet with great calamities, meet them because we have a body.\nIf we had not a body what calamity could reach us?\nTherefore he who honours the kingdom as his body can govern the kingdom.\nHe who loves the kingdom as his own body can be trusted with the kingdom.",
        "14": "Looking at it, you do not see it, you call it Invisible.\nListening to it, you do not hear it, you call it Inaudible.\nTouching it, you do not grasp it, you call it Intangible.\nThese three cannot be described, but they blend, and are One.\nAbove, it is not bright;\nBelow, it is not dim;\nUnceasingly, unceasingly,\nIt cannot be called by a Name,\nIt enters into Form, and returns into Spirit.\nThat is why it is called Spiritual Form of Form, Spiritual Image of Image.\nThat is why it is called vague and indeterminate.\nMeet it, you cannot see its beginning;\nFollow it, and you cannot see its end.\nConsider the Tao of Old in order to arrange affairs of Now.\nTo be able to know the Life-Spring of Old is to give expression to the Thread of the Tao.",
        "15": "Of old, those who were leaders in good actions examined mysteries with deep penetration; searching deeply, they did not understand; even Masters did not understand; therefore their actions were void of strength.\nThey were timid, as those who cross a torrent in winter; irresolute, as those who fear their neighbours; grave, as strangers before their host; they effaced themselves as ice that melts; they were rough as undressed wood, empty as a valley, confused as troubled water.\nWho is able by quietness to make pure the troubled heart?\nWho is able by repose to become conscious of Inner Life?\nHe who safely maintains his consciousness of Life will find it to be inexhaustible.\nTherefore he will be able, though not faultless, to renew perfectness.",
        "16": "To arrive at ultimate quietness\nSteadfastly maintain repose.\nAll creatures together have form;\nI see them return again to their root.\nThe Master creatures come to perfect form,\nContinuously they return to their root.\nContinuous return to the root is called repose,\nRepose is called the law of return,\nThe law of return is called eternity.\nTo know eternity is called illumination.\nTo ignore eternity is to draw misfortune on oneself,\nTo know eternity is to be great of Soul,\nTo be great of soul is to be a ruler,\nTo be a ruler is to be greater than all,\nTo be greater than all is to be conscious of Life,\nTo be conscious of Life is to endure.\nThe body shall disappear but not decay.",
        "17": "In ancient times\nThe people knew that they had rulers.\nThen they loved and praised them,\nThen they feared them,\nThen they despised them.\nThe rulers did not trust the people,\nThe people did not trust the rulers.\nThe rulers were grave, their words were precious.\nThe people having finished their work,\nand brought it to a successful issue, said:\n\"We affirm the Self.\"",
        "18": "Great Tao lost,\nThere came the duty to man and right conduct.\nWisdom and shrewdness appearing,\nThere came great hypocrisy.\nThe six relationships inharmonious,\nThere came filial piety deep, deep in the heart.\nKingdoms, families, and clans at war,\nThere came loyal Ministers.",
        "19": "If the people renounce self-control and reject wisdom,\nLet them gain simplicity and purity\nIf the people renounce duty to man and reject right conduct,\nLet them return to filial piety deep, deep in the heart.\nIf they renounce skill and leave off search for profit,\nLet them rob and by violence take possession of spiritual life.\nThese three things do not help our progress.\nTherefore now let us seek\nTo perceive simplicity,\nTo conserve beauty in the heart,\nTo curb selfishness and to have few desires.",
        "20": "Renounce learning, it brings loss to the Inner Life.\nHow slight the difference between Yes and Yea!\nHow great the difference between Good and Evil!\nThat which men fear is indeed to be feared.\nWhen men give themselves up to disorder it never stops.\nMany men rejoice and rejoice over a supply of good food, over being in a high and exalted position.\nI am calm, I do not feel the slightest emotion, like a new-born child which cannot yet smile at its mother, without attachment to anything, returning always to the Inner Life.\nMany men have superfluous possessions.\nI have nothing that I value; I desire that my heart be completely subdued, emptied to emptiness.\nMen of wealth are in the daylight of prosperity.\nI am in the dark.\nMen of wealth are endowed with penetration.\nI appear confused and ignorant.\nSuddenly I am, as it were, on a vast sea, floating on the sea of Inner Life which is boundless.\nMany men are full of ability.\nI appear to be stupid and rustic.\nThus I am different from other men.\nBut I revere the Mother, Sustainer of all beings.",
        "21": "The complete manifestation of things visible proceeds only from Life.\nIn its nature Life is always coming into activity, yet in itself it eludes our sight and tough.\nEluding sight! eluding touch!\nWithin it are hid the plane of created things.\nEluding touch! eluding sight!\nWithin it are hid all created beings.\nIt is profound! It is obscure!\nWithin it is hid pure Spirit.\nIt is pure Spirit, enfolding Truth!\nWithin it is hid an infallible witness.\nFree of Old until Now\nIts Name remains unchanged.\nThrough its Doorway comes the Universe into existence.\nHow do I know that the Universe is coming to full perfection through Life?\nThe witness is in Life itself.",
        "22": "That which is incomplete becomes complete.\nThe crooked becomes straight,\nThe empty becomes full,\nThe worn-out becomes new.\nHe who obtains has little,\nHe who scatters has much.\nThat is why the self-controlled man holds to Unity and brings it into manifestation for men.\nHe looks not at self, therefore he sees clearly;\nHe asserts not himself, therefore he shines;\nHe boasts not of self, therefore he has merit;\nHe glorifies not himself, therefore he endures.\nThe Master indeed does not strive, yet no one in the world can strive against him.\nThe words of the Ancients were not empty words:\n\"That which is incomplete becomes complete.\"\nAcquire completeness by returning it.",
        "23": "With few words affirm the Self.\nA great wind does not blow all the morning,\nA heavy wind does not continue all day.\nWhy is this so?\nIt is because of the inter-relations of Heaven and Earth.\nIf Heaven and Earth cannot make things last long.\nHow much less can man?\nTherefore he who follows the service of Tao is one with Tao,\nHe who is virtuous is one with Teh,\nHe who fails is one with failure.\nHe who is one with Tao,\nTao shall also claim him.\nHe who is one with Teh\nTeh shall also claim him.\nHe who is one with failure,\nFailure shall also claim him.\nFaith that is not complete is not faith.",
        "24": "He who stands on tiptoe is not steady,\nHe who holds legs stiffly cannot walk.\nHe who looks at self does not see clearly.\nHe who asserts himself does not shine.\nHe who boasts of himself has no merit.\nHe who glorifies himself shall not endure.\nThese things are to the Tao like excreta or a hideous tumour to the body.\nTherefore he who has Tao must give them no place.",
        "25": "There was a Being already perfect before the existence of Heaven and Earth.\nIt is calm! It is formless!\nIt stands alone and changes not!\nReaching everywhere and inexhaustible,\nIt may be regarded as Mother of the Universe.\nI do not know its name.\nFor a title we call it the Tao.\nIf forced to give it a name we call it the Great.\nGreat, we call it the Flowing,\nFlowing we call it distant,\nDistant, we call it Coming again.\nTherefore the Tao is Great, Heaven is Great,\nThe Earth is Great, the Ruler is also Great.\nIn the Universe four are Great,\nAnd the Ruler is one of them.\nMan finds his law in the Earth.\nThe Earth finds its law in Heaven,\nHeaven finds its law in the Tao,\nThe Tao finds its law in the affirmation of Self.",
        "26": "Gravity is the root of lightness,\nQuiescence is the master of motion.\nThat is why a king's son though he may travel all day long, does not cease to be quiet and grave; though he may achieve glory he abides in restfulness, he affirms his detachment.\nHow sad it would be if the Lord of a thousand chariots should conduct himself lightly in the kingdom!\nIf his conduct is light, he will fail as a Minister;\nIf he is hasty in action, he will fail as a Ruler.",
        "27": "He who walks in goodness leaves his trace in the Inner Life.\nHe who speaks in goodness carries no blame to the Inner Life.\nHe who reckons in goodness does not need to use a tally.\nThe good man has power to close the inner door and no one can open it.\nThe good man has power to tie the inner knot and no one can untie it.\nThat is why the self-controlled man always uses goodness in helping men, thus he draws them to the Inner Life.\nHe always uses goodness in helping creatures, thus he draws them to the Inner Life.\nThis is called being doubly illuminated.\nTherefore the good man masters the man who is not good,\nAnd the man who is not good is helper to the good man.\nHe who does not honour his master,\nHe who does not love his helper,\nThough counted wise, is greatly deceived.\nThis is called important and mysterious.",
        "28": "To know manly strength, to guard womanly gentleness,\nIs to be the central channel of the kingdom.\nTo be the central channel of the kingdom, always manifesting life, never guilty, is to return to the innocence of childhood.\nTo know light, to guard the darkness,\nIs to be the model of the kingdom.\nTo be the model of the kingdom, always manifesting life, never at fault, is to return to the bounds of the Inner Kingdom.\nTo know glory, to guard humility,\nIs to be the valley of the kingdom.\nTo be the valley of the kingdom, always manifesting life becoming perfect, is to return to a condition like undressed wood.\nUndressed wood, being made into many utensils,\nThe self-controlled man uses them,\nThen he becomes Ruler for a long time,\nThus he achieves greatness without hurt to anyone.",
        "29": "If you desire to gain the kingdom by action,\nI see that you will not succeed.\nThe kingdom is a spiritual vessel,\nIt cannot be gained by action.\nHe who acts, destroys it\nHe who grasps, loses it.\nTherefore behold the animals:\nSome go in front, others follow;\nSome are warm, others cold;\nSome are strong, others feeble;\nSome keep moving, others are still.\nThat is why the self-controlled man puts away excess, he puts away egotism, he puts away easy living.",
        "30": "He who would help a Ruler of men by Tao\nDoes not take soldiers to give strength to the kingdom.\nHis service is well rewarded.\nWhere troops dwell, there grow thorns and briers.\nAfter great wars, there follow bad years.\nHe who loves, bears fruit unceasingly,\nHe does not dare to conquer by strength.\nHe bears fruit, but not with assertiveness,\nHe bears fruit, but not with boastfulness,\nHe bears fruit, but not with meanness,\nHe bears fruit, but not to obtain it for himself,\nHe bears fruit, but not to shew his strength.\nMan is great and strong, then he is old,\nIn this he is not of Tao.\nIf he is not of Tao\nHe will quickly perish.",
        "31": "The Master who is a Captain of soldiers\nDoes not give blessings with his weapons.\nSoldiers' weapons are hated by most men,\nTherefore he who has the Tao gives them no place.\nIn the dwelling of the man of peace the left side is the place of honour.\nIn soldiers' usage the right side is the place of honour.\nA soldier does not give blessings with his weapons.\nThey are not the instruments of a man of peace.\nA man of peace will not possess them, nor use them;\nHe gives the first place to calmness and repose.\nIf he conquers, he does not rejoice.\nWithout joy is he who wounds and kills men.\nThe Master who wounds and kills men\nCannot succeed in ruling his kingdom.\nIn time of joy, the left hand is preferred,\nIn time of mourning, the right hand is preferred.\nIn war, the second in command is placed on the left,\nThe first in command is placed on the right,\nThat is, he stands in the place of mourning.\nHe who has killed many men should weep with many tears.\nHe who has conquered in battle should stand in the place of mourning.",
        "32": "The Name of Inner Life is Everlasting Tao.\nIf only he is pure, though he may be small,\nThe Servant of Tao dares to stand against the world.\nTao is able to maintain the unity of prince and people;\nIt subdues and binds all beings with each other;\nIt united Heaven and Earth harmoniously to produce sweet dew;\nIt gathers the people in the bonds of time and individuality.\nThe Name produces, divides, and brings to life;\nThings produced ever return into the name.\nThe Master also shall know how to rest in it.\nKnowing how to rest in it means that he never will decay.\nOn the earth everywhere Tao exists,\nAs the waters are collected in the valleys\nAnd return into the rivers and the seas.",
        "33": "He who knows men is wise,\nHe who knows himself can see clearly.\nHe who conquers men has strength,\nHe who conquers himself has power\nHe who knows that he has enough is rich,\nHe who acts with energy has a strong will.\nHe who fails not to find the Self shall endure,\nHe who dies, but does not perish, shall endure for ever.",
        "34": "Great Tao flows everywhere,\nIt extends to the left and to the right.\nAll beings receive It in order to live and be free.\nIt works out perfectness in them although It possesses not a Name.\nIt protects them with love and sustains them, but does not claim to be Ruler of their actions.\nAlways seeking the innermost, you may say that Its Name is in the Small.\nAll beings return again into It, yet It does not claim to be Ruler of their actions.\nYou may say that Its Name is in the Great.\nThat is why, to the end of his life, the self-controlled man is not great in action,\nThus he is able to perfect his greatness.",
        "35": "Hold fast the idea of \"The Great,\"\nThen all men will be drawn to you.\nThey will come to you and receive no hurt,\nBut rest, peace and great calm.\nWhen you provide music and exquisite food\nThe traveller will stay with you gladly.\nWhen the Tao flows out from you to him\nBy his palate he does not detect its savour,\nBy his eye he cannot perceive it,\nBy his ears he cannot hear it,\nBut in using it he finds it to be inexhaustible.",
        "36": "If you desire to breathe deeply, you must first empty the lungs.\nIf you desire to be strong, you must first learn to be weak.\nIf you desire to be in a lofty position, you must first learn to take a lowly position.\nIf you desire to be enriched by gifts, you must first give away all that you have.\nThis is called concealment and enlightenment.\nThe soft overcomes the hard.\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\nFish cannot swim safely in shallow waters.\nThe secrets of government of a kingdom should not be revealed to the people.",
        "37": "The activity of Everlasting Tao is in the Inner Kingdom,\nIt does not act except through the innermost.\nIf prince and people can maintain it together,\nAll beings will be transformed from within themselves;\nBeing transformed, they again desire action.\nWe must learn to still desire\nTo obtain in the Inner Life Purity of the Name.\nPurity of the Name in the Inner Life\nBrings absence of desire;\nAbsence of desire brings stillness;\nThus shall the world be perfected from within itself.",
        "38": "To assume virtue without being really virtuous is to be virtuous from duty;\nTo be less virtuous, yet not to lose real virtue, is to be virtuous from Inner Life.\nSupreme virtue comes through activity of Inner Life; then let us actively seek Inner Life.\nTO be less virtuous and to practice it, let us be active in the performance of duty.\nTo assume benevolence and practice it let us actively seek Inner Life.\nTo assume right conduct and practice it let us be active in the performance of duty.\nTo assume expediency and practice it is to find that no one honours it; then it bares the arm, and asserts itself by force.\nTherefore, when Tao is lost, follow Virtue; when virtue is lost, follow benevolence; when benevolence is lost, follow right conduct; when right conduct is lost, follow expediency.\nThose who are Masters of expediency have in the heart only the shadow of faith; and in the mind only confusion.\nThose who are Leaders of politeness have only the husk of Tao, which is the source of ignorance.\nThat is why the greatest of the Masters abide in the real,\nThey do not abide in the shadow.\nThey hold to the fruit, they do not hold to the husk.\nTherefore they put away the latter and take hold of the former.",
        "39": "These are they which from of Old have obtained Unity.\nHeaven obtained Unity by purity;\nhe earth obtained Unity by repose;\nSpiritual beings obtained Unity by lack of bodily form;\nThe valleys obtained Unity by fulness;\nAll beings obtained Unity by life;\nPrinces and people obtained Unity by being under the rule of Heaven.\nThese all obtained permanence by Unity.\nThe innermost of Heaven is purity, if not so, it would be obscured;\nThe innermost of Earth is repose, it not so, it would disintegrate;\nThe innermost of spiritual beings is lack of bodily form, if not so, they would die;\nThe innermost of valleys is fulness of water, if not so, they would be sterile;\nThe innermost of creatures is life, if not so, they would perish.\nThe high honour of prince and people is in their being together under the rule of Inner Life, if not so, they would soon lose harmony,\nThe root of honour is in humility,\nThe standpoint of high estate is in lowliness.\nThat is why prince and people call themselves orphans, solitary men, chariots without wheels.\nThe active principle of their Unity is in lowliness.\nWho can deny this?\nIf you take a chariot to pieces, you have no chariot (it has lost its Unity).\nDo not desire to be isolated as a single gem, nor to be lost in a crowd as pebbles on the beach.",
        "40": "He who returns is sent forth by Tao,\nHe who is weak is used by Tao.\nIn the world things are born into existence,\nExisting things are born into Inner Life.",
        "41": "When great scholars heard of Tao, they diligently followed it.\nWhen mediocre scholars heard of Tao, sometimes they kept it, sometimes they lost it.\nWhen inferior scholars heard of Tao, they laughed at it.\nWhether they laugh or whether they follow, Tao remains active.\nTherefore the poets have said:\nBrightness of Tao seems to be dark,\nProgress in Tao seems going back,\nThe aim of Tao seems confused.\nThe highest Tao seems lowliest,\nGreat purity seems full of shame,\nThe fullest Teh seems incomplete.\nTeachers of Teh have lost their zeal\nAnd certain Truth appears to change.\nA great square with inner angles,\nA great vase unfinished,\nA great voice never heard,\nA great Image with inner form.\nTao is hid within its Name,\nBut by Tao the Masters bless,\nAnd all things bring to perfectness.",
        "42": "In Tao is Unity of Life,\nIn Unity is Duality of Life,\nIn Duality is Trinity of Life,\nIn Trinity all beings have life.\nAll beings shun the principle of Inertia,\nThey hold to the principle of Life.\nThey are brought into deep harmony by the Breath of the Deep.\nThat which men dislike is to be called orphans, solitary, wheels without naves;\nYet princes and rulers may thus be named.\nTherefore some are increased by being diminished,\nAnd some are diminished by being increased.\nThat which men have taught I also shall teach:\n\"He who is strong and violent shall not meet with easy death.\"\nI shall in this way teach fundamentals.",
        "43": "In the world when we arrive at gentleness we press forward to overcome all hardness.\nTo possess Inner Life we enter it by our own private doorway.\nWe do this in order to know in overflowing fulness the possession of activity of Inner Life.\nOverflowing fulness of activity of Inner Life\nWith power to impart it to others without words -\nFew men in the world attain to this.",
        "44": "Which is more dear to you, your character or your body?\nWhich do you treasure more, your body or your wealth?\nWhich makes you more unhappy, to gain or to lose?\nBut we must sacrifice much to gain true love.\nWe must suffer great loss to obtain much treasure,\nTo know contentment is to fear no shame.\nTo know how to stop is to avoid destruction.\nThus doing, we shall long endure.",
        "45": "Esteem lightly your greatest accomplishment, your patience will not fail.\nReckon your great fulness to be emptiness, your strength will not become exhausted.\nCount your rectitude as foolishness,\nKnow your cleverness to be stupidity,\nRecognize your eloquence to be stammering words,\nAnd you will find that\nAs movement overcomes cold, and as stillness overcomes heat, even sol, he who knows the true secret of tranquillity\nWill become a pattern for all mankind.",
        "46": "When Tao was manifested to men,\nHorses were used for cultivating the fields.\nWhen Tao was hid within itself,\nWar horses were reared on the frontiers.\nThere is no sin greater than desire,\nThere is no misfortune greater than discontent,\nThere is no calamity greater than the wish to acquire,\nTherefore to be satisfied is an everlasting sufficiency.",
        "47": "Without going out of my door I know the Universe.\nWithout opening my window I perceive Heavenly Tao.\nThe more I go abroad, the less I understand.\nThat is why the self-controlled man arrives without going, names things without seeing them, perfects without activity.",
        "48": "By activity in learning we are daily enriched.\nBy activity of Tao we are daily diminished, diminished and yet more diminished, until we arrive at activity of Inner Life, and activity of Inner Life becomes stillness of Inner Life.\nBy the practice of Inner Life stillness we can continually conquer all things.\nBy the practice of returning to possessions, nothing that we conquer will be sufficient for us.",
        "49": "The Heart of the self-controlled man is always in the Inner Kingdom.\nHe draws the hearts of all men into his Heart.\nIf a man is good, he blesses him;\nIf a man is not good, still he blesses him with the Blessing of Teh.\nIf a man is faithful, he is faithful to him,\nIf a man is not faithful, still he is faithful to him with the Faithfulness of Teh.\nThe self-controlled man dwells in the world.\nPatiently and persistently\nHe brings the whole world into active community of Heart.\nAll men turn their ears and their eyes towards him.\nThey are all children of the self-controlled man.",
        "50": "We come into Life, we enter Death.\nThree out of ten men follow the way of Life.\nThree out of ten men follow the way of Death\nAlso there are three out of ten who live as men and yet they move on to the place of Death.\nWhat a Master is he, therefore, who takes hold of life, of real Life!\nHe lives, his ears open to goodness, listening to hidden things.\nIn travelling, he fears not the rhinoceros nor tiger.\nIn entering the war-chariot, he dreads not the weapons of the soldier.\nCan a rhinoceros with his horn strike the Inner Life?\nCan a tiger with his claw tear the Inner Life?\nCan a soldier with his weapon pierce the valley of Inner Life?\nWhat a Master is he, therefore, who into the place of Death can bring his Inner Life!",
        "51": "Tao gives Life to all beings.\nTeh nourishes them.\nIt gives to each being its form.\nIt gives the inward urge towards perfectness.\nThat is why there is no living creature that does not reverence Tao and honour Teh.\nThe veneration of Tao!\nThe honour of Teh!\nNo Master has decreed it,\nBut eternally it affirms the Self.\nTherefore Tao gives Life to all beings,\nIt nourishes and makes them grow,\nIt rears them and perfects them,\nIt sustains, feeds, and protects them.\nIt gives them Life, but does not possess them.\nIt gives them activity, but does not depend o them.\nIt urges them to grow, but does not rule them.\nThis is called profound Teh.",
        "52": "While in the world gain possession of the Life-Spring in order that you may become a World-Mother.\nWhen you have attained to Motherhood you will know your children.\nWhen you know your children you will retain your Motherhood.\nThen, though the body may disappear, You will not be hurt.\nClose the door of the mouth,\nShut the doors of the senses,\nThroughout life your body will not be fatigued.\nOpen your mouth,\nIncrease your business affairs,\nThroughout life your body will not be safe.\nTo perceive the small is called clear vision.\nTo guard the weak is called strength.\nFollow the Light, you will reflect its radiance.\nNeglect the Inner Life, your body will meet with calamity.\nThis is called the eternal heritage.",
        "53": "If I have knowledge and resolute faith I shall walk in the Great Tao.\nIf I fear, I can only behave well outwardly.\nGreat Tao is very straight, But the people love by-roads.\nThe palace may be well kept, But the fields may be uncultivated And the granaries empty.\nThe Princes take more land,\nAt their girdle they carry a sword,\nThey eat dainty food,\nThey take possession of much gold.\nThat is called glorification of robbery.\nIt is not Tao.",
        "54": "He who is established in goodness shall not be uprooted.\nHe who cherishes goodness shall not be cast out.\nHis children to all generations shall be blessed unceasingly.\nCultivate it in the body, your Teh shall become true.\nCultivate it in the family, your Teh shall superabound.\nCultivate it in the village, your Teh shall endure.\nCultivate it in the kingdom, your Teh shall flourish.\nCultivate it in the world, your Teh shall be universal.\nTherefore, according to the body, judge the body.\nAccording to the family, judge the family.\nAccording to the village, judge the village.\nAccording to the kingdom, judge the kingdom.\nAccording to the world, judge the world..\nHow shall I know that there is some faith in the world?\nThe witness is in itself.",
        "55": "He who has his foundation in Teh is like a little child.\nPoisonous insects do not sting him, Wild beasts do not seize him, Birds of prey do not strike at him.\nHis bones are weak, his muscles soft, Yet he can take hold firmly.\nHe is ignorant of sex, but is full of vitality.\nHe will grow to maturity.\nAll day long he shouts and sings.\nHe will arrive at a knowledge of harmony.\nThe knowledge of harmony is called eternal.\nThe knowledge of eternal things is called clear vision.\nIncrease of life does not always bring happiness.\nThe life-force that gives birth to human emotion is strong.\nHuman emotion comes to full power and then grows old.\nIt is not Tao.\nIf it is not Tao, it will quickly perish.",
        "56": "He who knows, speaks not;\nHe who speaks, knows not.\nHe closes the mouth,\nHe shuts the doors of the senses.\nHe rounds off angles;\nHe unravels all difficulties.\nhe harmonizes Light.\nHe brings men into Unity.\nThis is called wonderful Unity.\nFavour and disgrace do not touch him,\nprofit and loss do not affect him,\nHonour and shame are alike to him,\nTherefore he is held in high esteem by all men.",
        "57": "To govern a kingdom, use righteousness.\nTo conduct a war, use strategy.\nTo be a true world-ruler, be occupied with Inner Life.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this:\nThe more restrictive the laws, the poorer the people.\nThe more machinery used, the more trouble in the kingdom.\nThe more clever and skilful the people, the more do they make artificial things.\nThe more the laws are in evidence, the more do thieves and robbers abound.\nThat is why the self-controlled man says:\nIf I act from Inner Life the people will become transformed in themselves.\nIf I love stillness the people will become righteous in themselves.\nIf I am occupied with Inner Life the people will become enriched in themselves.\nIf I love the Inner Life the people will become pure in themselves.",
        "58": "If the government is from the heart the people will be richer and richer.\nIf the government is full of restrictions the people will be poorer and poorer.\nMiserable! you rely on coming happiness.\nHappy! you crouch under dread of coming misery.\nYou may know the end from the beginning.\nIf a ruler is in line with Inner Life his strategy will come right, his bad luck will become good, and the people will be astonished.\nThings have been so for a long time.\nThat is why the self-controlled man is just and hurts no one, is true and takes no licence; he shines, and offends not by his brightness.",
        "59": "To govern men and to serve heaven nothing is better than to have a reserve.\nThe Master indeed has a reserve; it is called brilliant foresight.\nBrilliant foresight is called the increasing abundance of Teh.\nIf you have an ever-increasing abundance of Teh , then your Inner Life is unconquerable.\nIf you Inner Life in unconquerable, then its limits cannot be known.\nIf you cannot gauge the limits of your Inner Life, then you shall surely possess the kingdom.\nIf you possess the Mother of the kingdom,\nYou shall endure forever.\nThis is to be deep rooted and to have a firm foundation.\nThe possessor of Tao shall have enduring life and infinite vision.",
        "60": "Govern a Great State\nAs you would cook a small fish (do it gently).\nWhen Tao is manifest in the world\nEvil spirits have no power.\nWhen evil spirits have no power\nThey cannot hurt men.\nEvil spirits cannot hurt men.\nThe self-controlled man does not hurt men.\nThe Master also does not hurt men.\nTherefore they unite in manifesting Teh.",
        "61": "A great kingdom, lowly like running water, is the Meeting-place of the world.\nIt is the feminine quality of the world.\nThe feminine quality always overcomes the masculine by stillness.\nIn order to be still, we must become lowly.\nTherefore, if a great kingdom is lowly towards a little kingdom it will take possession of the little kingdom.\nIf a little kingdom is lowly towards a great kingdom it will take possession of the great kingdom.\nSo one becomes lowly in order to conquer,\nThe other is lowly and yet it conquers.\nIf a great kingdom only desires to unify and nourish men,\nIf a small kingdom only desires to enter in and serve men,\nThen the Master, in each case, shall obtain his desire.\nHe who is great ought to be lowly.",
        "62": "He who has the Tao is the refuge of all beings.\nHe is the treasure of the good man,\nHe is the support of the man who is not good.\nBeautiful words through Tao gain power,\nMan, by following it gains steadfastness in action,\nBut, by the evil man, its possession is ignored.\nThe Son of Heaven sits enthroned,\nHis three Ministers are appointed.\nOne carries inj his hand a tablet of jade:\nAnother is followed by a mounted retinue,\nBut the one who is most values sits quietly, and offers as his gift this Tao.\nHow was the Tao prized by men of Old?\nDaily they sought for it.\nThey found it, hid within the Self.\nIt gives a way of escape to the guilty.\nTherefore it is prized by all men.",
        "63": "Be active, with the Activity of Inner Life.\nServe, with the Service of Inner Life.\nBe fragrant, with the Fragrance of Inner Life.\nThe great shall be small,\nThe many shall be few, and\nEvil shall be recompensed by goodness.\nMediate on difficult things till they become easy.\nDo great deeds till they appear to be small.\nTo serve men in difficult things,\nWe must begin by easy things.\nTo serve men in great things,\nWe must begin by doing small things.\nThat is why the self-controlled man to the end of life does not become great, and thus he can perfect his greatness.\nThe Master has little faith in a quickly mad promise.\nMany things are easy, many are also difficult.\nThe self-controlled man takes hold of difficulties.\nTo the end of life he solves difficulties in the Inner Life.",
        "64": "His Restfulness is easily maintained.\nEvents foreseen by him are easily arranged for.\nBy him weak things are easily bent,\nAnd small things are easily scattered.\nHe can stop an evil before it comes into existence.\nHe can keep a twig straight before it becomes crooked.\nBehold the girth of this tree!\nIt grew from a small filament of a stalk.\nThis tower of nine stories has its base upon a small space on the earth.\nThe journey of a thousand miles began with a footstep on the ground.\nHe who makes, unmakes.\nHe who grasps, lets go.\nThat is why the self-controlled man by Inner Life can make and by Inner life unmake, by Inner Life can grasp and by Inner Life let go.\nMen in business affairs come near perfection, then fail.\nIf they were as attentive at the end as at the beginning their business would succeed.\nThat is why the self-controlled man desires to have no wishes; he sets no value upon rare objects; he learns without study; he helps all beings by the outflow of his personality; and he does this without planning to do it.",
        "65": "Of Old, he who was active in Tao did not use it to make people enlightened, but to make them more kind.\nIf people are difficult to govern it is because they have too much knowledge.\nTherefore if you govern a kingdom by knowledge, you will be an oppressor of the kingdom.\nBut if you govern a kingdom by wisdom, you will give happiness to the kingdom.\nIf you know and do these things you will be a pattern for men.\nKnowledge of how to be always a pattern for men is called profound Teh.\nProfound Teh is in the very source of life, it pervades the utmost limits of life, it returns and dwells in every being.\nWhen fully manifested, it unites all beings in a great harmony.",
        "66": "The Rivers and the Seas (because they seek a lowly place) are Lords of a hundred valleys\nLet your love flow, seek a lowly place, you will be Lord of a hundred valleys.\nThat is why if the self-controlled man desires to exalt the people, in his speech he must take a lowly place; if he desires to put the put the people first he must put himself after them.\nThus, though he dwells above them, the people are not burdened by him\nThough he is placed before them, the people are not obstructed by him,\nTherefore men serve him gladly, they do not tire in serving him.\nBecause he does not strive, no one in the world can strive against him.",
        "67": "In the world many call me great, yet I seem to have no intelligence.\nThe Master indeed is great, yet he also seems to have no intelligence.\nAs regards our intelligence, its smallness is of long continuance.\nThe Master and I have three treasures,\nWe hold them and prize them.\nThe first is called \"Deep Love,\"\nThe second is called \"Protectiveness,\"\nThe third is called \"Not planning to be first.\"\nHaving Deep Love, you then can have courage.\nHaving Protectiveness, you then can give freely.\nNot planning to be first, you will be a perfect instrument that will endure.\nNow, men neglect Deep Love and seek courage,\nThey put aside Protectiveness and see extravagance.\nThey leave the second place and seek the first, Then death comes.\nThe Master fights by means of Love, then he conquers.\nHe keeps guard by means of it, then he is impregnable.\nHeaven will save him and Love will defend him.",
        "68": "He who loves, in being a soldier is not warlike.\nHe who loves, in fighting is not angry.\nHe who loves, in conquering does not grasp fo self.\nHe who loves, in employing men is lowly before them.\nThis is called Manifestation of non-greed.\nIt is called the power of using men.\nIt is called Unity with Heaven.\nOf Old it was man's highest aim.",
        "69": "A great soldier used to say:\n\"I plan not to be a Lord, but to be a follower; I plan not to advance an inch, but to recede a foot.\"\nThis is called:\nAdvancing with the advantage of Inner Life, baring the arm with the energy of Inner Life, grasping a weapon with the force of Inner Life, meeting the foe as a soldier of Inner Life.\nThere is no calamity greater than lightly to engage in war.\nTo engage lightly in war is to lose our treasure of gentleness.\nTherefore, when soldiers meet who are equally strong,\nHe who is compassionate shall conquer.",
        "70": "My words are very easily known.\nThey are very easily practiced.\nNo one in the world can fully know them,\nNo one in the world can fully practice them.\nMy words come from one Source,\nMy service is to one Ruler.\nThe Master indeed knows the Inner Kingdom,\nThat is why he knows the negation of self.\nFew there are who know the self.\nBecause they know it not, they prize the self.\nThat is why the self-controlled man wears wool.\nBut in his bosom are jewels.",
        "71": "To know that we are ignorant is a high attainment.\nTo be ignorant and to think we know is a defect.\nThe Master indeed can cure this defect.\nThat is why he has not this defect.\nThe self-controlled man has not this defect,\nHe takes hold of his defect and cures it.\nThat is why he has not this defect.",
        "72": "If the people do not dread majesty,\nThen great majesty will come to them.\nLet them guard the innermost of their dwellings,\nLet them press towards the innermost of their life.\nThe Master indeed is not bound,\nThat is why he is not bound.\nThat is how the self-controlled man knows the Self and perceives the not-Self.\nHe loves the Self, and honours the not-Self.\nTherefore he passes away from the latter and takes hold of the former.",
        "73": "A man with courage and daring is slain,\nA man with courage and self-restraint lives.\nOf these two, the one has benefit, the other has injury.\nWho can tell why one of them should incur Heaven's Wrath?\nBecause of this the self-controlled man has doubt and difficulty.\nHeavenly Tao strives not, but conquers by love;\nIt speaks not, but responds in Love;\nIt calls not to men, but of themselves they come;\nIt slowly is made manifest, yet its plans are laid in Love.\nThe net of Heaven is widely meshed; the meshes are far apart, yet nothing escapes from it.",
        "74": "If the people do not fear death,\nHow then can you frighten them by death?\nBut if you cause the people continually to fear death,\nAnd if one of them becomes a great criminal,\nCan you take hold of him and slay him?\nWould you dare to this?\nThere is always one, the Executioner, who kills men.\nBut, on the contrary, if you kill as if you were Executioner,\nIt would be as if you tried to do the work of a Master Carpenter.\nIn attempting to do the work of a Master Carpenter,\nFew there be who do not wound their own hands.",
        "75": "The people are hungry.\nBecause they who are over the food tax it heavily\nThat is why the people are hungry.\nThe people are difficult to govern.\nBecause the rulers trust in possessions and activities\nThat is why the people are difficult to govern.\nThe people make light of death.\nBecause they work hard in order to save their life,\nThat is why they make light of death.\nA Master indeed is he whose life-activities are from within.\nHe excels all man in his application of Life.",
        "76": "In life, man is soft and tender,\nIn death, he is rigid and hard.\nIn life, plants and trees are soft and pliant,\nIn death, they are withered and tough.\nThus rigidity and hardness are companions of death.\nSoftness and tenderness are companions of life.\nThat is why the soldier who trusts only in strength does not conquer,\nThe tree that relies on its strength invites the axe.\nGreat strength dwells below,\nSoftness and tenderness dwell above.",
        "77": "Heavenly Tao is like the bending of a bow.\nThat which is high is bent downwards,\nThat which is low is raised up,\nThat which is too much is lessened,\nThat which is not enough is increased.\nHeavenly Tao takes from those who have too much,\nAnd gives to those who have not enough.\nThe way of man is not thus,\nHe takes from those who have not enough,\nAnd gives to those who already have too much.\nWho is able to hold his wealth in order to give it to men?\nOnly he who has the Tao.\nThat is why the self-controlled man acts without looking for reward, he brings to perfectness without claiming credit, he desires not to let his wosdom appear.",
        "78": "Of the soft and weak things in the world\nNone is weaker than water.\nBur in overcoming that which is firm and strong\nNothing can equal it.\nIt is easy to know the inner meaning of this: \"That which is weak conquers the strong, that which is soft conquers the hard.\"\nAll men know this, No one is able to practice it.\nThat is why the self-controlled man says:\n\"He who fears the reproach of the Kingdom is called Ruler of the Land. He who bears the woes of the Kingdom is called King of the land.\"\nTrue words in paradox.",
        "79": "To harmonize great enemies\nWe must possess that which far surpasses enmity.\nWe must be able to be at peace\nIn order to be active in Love.\nThat is why the self-controlled man holds the left-hand portion of the contract, but does not insist upon the other man producing his portion.\nHe who is virtuous may rule by a contract,\nHe whose virtue is within may rule by destroying it.\nAkin to Heavenly Tao is Inner Life.\nA constant giver is the man who loves.",
        "80": "Take a small kingdom and a few people,\nCause ten or a hundred of them to carry weapons,\nBut not to use them.\nCause the people to fear death,\nDo not let them travel far,\nThough they may have boats and carriages,\nLet them use them only within the kingdom.\nThough they may have soldiers in uniform,\nLet them parade only within the kingdom.\nCause the people again to have knotted cords,\nAnd to use them (instead of written characters).\nTheir food would be sweet,\nTheir clothing would be beautiful in their own eyes,\nTheir dwellings would be resting-places,\nThey would love their simple ways.\nIf another kingdom were so near\nThat they could hear the sounds of dogs and fowls,\nThey would not come into mutual contact\nUntil they all grew old and died.",
        "81": "Faithful words may not be beautiful,\nBeautiful words may not be faithful.\nThose who love do not quarrel,\nThose who quarrel do not love.\nThose who know are not learned,\nThose who are learned do not know.\nThe riches of the self-controlled man are in the Inner Life.\nWhen he spends for others, he has more for himself.\nWhen he gives to others, he has much more for himself.\nHeavenly Tao blesses all and hurts no one.\nThe way of the self-controlled man is to act and not to fight."
