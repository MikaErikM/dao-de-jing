    "1": "Chapter One\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken of is not the ever-constant\n      Dao.\nThe name that can be named is not the ever-constant name.\nThat which is without-name is the beginning of heaven and\n      earth.\nThat which possesses a name is the mother of the ten\n      thousand creatures.\n \nTherefore : always without-desire, thus you observe its\n      subtle mystery.\nAlways possessing desires, thus you observe its external\n      appearances.\nThese two, they arise from the same source but have\n      different names;\nThis sameness is called their deep mystery.\n \nDeep mysteries, and again deep mysteries –\nThe gateway of many subtle mysteries.",
    "2": "Chapter Two\n\nIn the world, when all know that the action of beauty is\n      beautiful, then ugliness ensues.\nWhen all know that the action of good is goodness, then\n      not-good ensues.                   \n \nTherefore : being and non-being create each other,\nDifficult and easy complete each other,\nLong and short contrast each other,\nHigh and low lean on each other,\nTone and voice harmonize each other,\nBefore and after follow each other.\n \nThus the sage :\nLives by using non-action in his duties,\nAnd practicing no-talking in his teachings.\n \nThe ten thousand creatures arise, but do not have a\n      beginning.\nCreating but not possessing;\nActing, but not concerned with the results;\nAccomplishing tasks, but not dwelling on them.         \n \nNow : only because there is no dwelling,\nThus the results do not depart.",
    "3": "Chapter Three\n\nNot honoring those who are esteemable\nEnsures that the citizens do not strive.\nNot valuing rare goods\nEnsures that the citizens do not act like thieves.\nNot showing that which can be desired\nEnsures that the citizens’ heart/minds do not become\n      confused.\n \nThus the governing of the sage\nEmpties their heart/minds, fills their stomachs,\nWeakens their ambitions, strengthens their bones.\n \nBy always ensuring that the citizens are\n      without-knowledge and without-desire,\nThose who make men wise will not dare to act.\n \nAct with non-action, then all will be governed!",
    "4": "Chapter Four\n\nDao is like a cup or bowl, yet use it and there exists no\n      need to fill it.\nProfound and deep!, it appears to be the ancestor of the ten\n      thousand creatures.\n \nIt blunts their sharpness,\nLoosens their tangles,\nSoftens their brightness,\nMakes them the same as the dust of the world.\n \nDeep and profound!, it seems to barely exist.\nI do not know whose child it is –\nIts image came before that of god.",
    "5": "Chapter Five\n\nHeaven and earth are not kind –\nThus the ten thousand creatures become as straw dogs to\n      them.\nThe sage is not kind –\nThus the 100 families become as straw dogs to him.\n \nThe space between heaven and earth,\nHow is it just like a bellows or flute?\nIt is empty, yet does not run out.\nThe more it moves, and the more it produces.\n \nToo much talking is exceptionally exhausting,\nWhich is not as good as maintaining what is within.",
    "6": "Chapter Six\n\nThe spirit of the valley does not die –\nIt is called the deep and mysterious feminine.\n \nThe gateway of this deep and mysterious feminine – \nIt is called the source of heaven and earth.\n \nUnbroken, it seems to exist.\nUsing it takes no effort.",
    "7": "Chapter Seven\n\nHeaven is eternal, earth is enduring.                           \nThe reason that heaven and earth can be eternal and\n      enduring\nIs because they do not live for themselves.\nTherefore they can live forever.         \n \nThus the sage :\nPuts his self behind others, yet finds his self before them.\nConsiders his self extraneous, yet his self survives.\n \nIs this not because he has no self-interests?\nTherefore he can achieve his self-interests.",
    "8": "Chapter Eight\n\nThe highest virtue is like water –\nWater’s virtue benefits the ten thousand creatures, yet it\n      does not strive.\nIt dwells in places that everyone detests,\nTherefore it is almost comparable to Dao!\n \nIn dwelling, the virtue is in the land.\nIn your heart/mind, the virtue is in being profound and\n      deep.\nIn relations, the virtue is in being kind.\nIn speech, the virtue is in being truthful.\nIn governing, the virtue is in being honest and just.\nIn your duties, the virtue is in being competent.\nIn action, the virtue is in the timing.\n \nNow : only because there is no striving,\nTherefore there is no blame.",
    "9": "Chapter Nine\n\nHolding and filling it\nAre not as good as your stopping short.\n \nHammering and sharpening it\nCan not be forever maintained.\n \nWhen gold and jade fill a room,\nThere is no one who can protect it.\n \nTo have wealth and high rank, but with arrogance –\nThen naturally their loss is your own fault.\n \nWhen the task is successful, the self should let go of it.         \nThis is the Way of heaven.",

    "12": "Chapter Twelve\n\nThe five colors can make people’s eyes blind.\nThe five tones can make people’s ears deaf.\nThe five flavors can make people’s mouths dull.\nExcessive hunting and horse racing can make people’s\n      heart/minds become wild.  \nRare goods can make people’s behavior corrupt.       \n \nThus the sage :\nActs on what is inside, he does not act on what he sees.\nTherefore he leaves that and chooses this.",
    "13": "Chapter Thirteen\n\nFavor and disgrace seem alarming.\nHigh rank brings great suffering if you have a self.\n \nWhat is meant by “favor and disgrace seem alarming”?\nFavor makes you the inferior, so gaining it seems alarming.\nLosing it also seems alarming.\nThis is what is meant by “favor and disgrace seem\n      alarming”.\n \nWhat is meant by “high rank brings great suffering if you\n      have a self”?\nI am the reason that I have great suffering, I who act like\n      I have a self.\nWhen I am beyond my body, how can I be visited by diseases?\n \nTherefore : he who is high ranking and uses his self to\n      serve the world –\nIt seems he can thus be entrusted with the world!\nHe who is loving and uses his self to serve the world –\nIt seems he can thus be entrusted with the world!",
    "14": "Chapter Fourteen\n\nLook, it is not seen; its name is called elusive.\nListen, it is not heard; its name is called tenuous.\nGrasp, it is not gotten; its name is called subtle and\n      obscure.\nThese three things can not be investigated any further –\nTherefore they blend and become one.\n \nThis one thing :\nIts highest point is not bright;\nIts lowest point is not dark.\nContinuous and unending!, it can not be named;\nIt returns to non-existence.\nIt is called the form of that which is without-form;\nThe image of non-existence.\nIt is called confusing and indistinct.\nMeet it and you do not see its beginning;\nFollow it and you do not see its end.\n \nHold fast to the Way of the ancients\nIn order to master the present moment.\nThe ability to know the ancient beginning –\nThis is called the main principle of Dao.",
    "15": "Chapter Fifteen\n\nThe virtue of the ancients made they who were scholars\n      subtle, mysterious, obscure, deep, and penetrating.\nTheir mysterious depths can not be understood.\n \nNow : only because they can not be understood,\nTherefore we try to emulate their appearance :\nHesitant!, as if crossing a winter stream.\nWary!, as if afraid of their neighbors all around.        \nRespectful!, they are like a visiting guest.\nYielding!, like ice that is about to to break off.\nHonest and genuine!, they are like the uncarved block.\nWide and open!, they are like a valley.\nUnclear!, they are like muddy water.\n \nWho can take muddy water and use stillness to slowly and\n      gently make it pure and clear?\nWho can take what is tranquil and use continual movement\n      to slowly and gently bring it to life?\n \nHe who maintains this Way does not desire to be full.\nNow : only because he is not full,\nThus he can be hidden and unfinished.",
    "16": "Chapter Sixteen\n\nAttain the utmost emptiness.\nMaintain a profound stillness.\n \nThe ten thousand creatures arise in unison,\nAnd thus I observe their return.\nNow : all the myriad creatures return to their source.\nReturning to the source speaks of stillness.\nStillness is called returning to the natural order.\nReturning to the natural order speaks of the\n      ever-constant.\n \nKnowing the ever-constant speaks of insight.\nNot knowing the ever-constant is foolish and creates\n      misfortune.\n \nKnowing the ever-constant leads to tolerance.\nBeing tolerant leads to being just and unbiased.\nBeing just and unbiased leads to being kingly.\nBeing kingly leads to heaven.\nHeaven leads to Dao.\nDao leads to what endures.\n \nWhen the self disappears, there can be no danger.",
    "17": "Chapter Seventeen\n\nThe existence of the best ruler is barely known to the\n      people.\nNext is one who they love and praise.\nNext is one who they fear.\nNext is one who they ridicule.\n \nIf the ruler does not trust enough, then he will not have\n      anyone’s trust.\n \nThoughtful!, he values his words.\n \nWhen tasks are accomplished and duties are successful,\nThe 100 families all say “we are naturally so”.",
    "18": "Chapter Eighteen\n\nWhen the great Dao is abandoned,\nThere exists kindness and morality.\n \nWhen intelligence and wisdom arise,\nThere exists a great deal of deception.\n \nWhen the six relationships are not in harmony,\nThere exists devoted children and loving parents.\n \nWhen the nation and the families are very confused,\nThere exists loyal officials.",
    "19": "Chapter Nineteen\n\nRenounce saintliness, abandon wisdom,\nAnd the citizens benefit 100-fold.\nRenounce kindness, abandon morality,\nAnd the citizens return to being devoted children and\n      loving parents.\nRenounce cleverness, abandon profit,\nAnd thieves and bandits will not exist.\n \nThese three things thus make a civilized society, but are\n      not enough.\n \nTherefore : to ensure the citizens have a place to belong–\nSee the simplicity,\nEmbrace the concept of the uncarved block,\nLess selfishness,\nFewer desires.",
    "20": "Chapter Twenty\n\nRenounce learning and be without worry.\n \n“Yes” together with “yeah” –\nWhat is their mutual distance or nearness?\nBeautiful together with ugliness –\nWhat is their mutual distance or similarity?\n \nThat which people fear, they are not able to not fear.\nHow ridiculous! They are not yet centered!\n \nEveryone is very festive,\nAs if enjoying the Tai Lao sacrifice,\nAs if climbing terraces in the spring.\nI alone am unmoved! –\nLike one who has not yet given any sign,\nLike a newborn infant who does not yet act like a baby.\nVery tired and worn out!, as if without a place to return\n      to.\n \nEveryone all has more than they need;\nI alone seem to have lost everything.\nI have the heart/mind of a foolish person, indeed!!\nI am very mixed up and confused!\n \nCommon people are very clear and bright;\nI alone seem confused.\nCommon people are very observant and alert;\nI alone am very gloomy and depressed.\nTranquil!, they are like the ocean;\nI drift on the wind!, as if without a place to rest.\nEveryone all has a purpose;\nI alone am stupid and stubborn, and appear mean and\n      shallow.\nI alone am different compared to other people,\nAnd treasure being embraced by Mother.",
    "21": "Chapter Twenty One\n\nThe greatest De is possible only when Dao is followed.\n \nThe action of Dao on creatures is just indistinct, just\n      confusing.\nConfusing! and indistinct!, within it exists image.\nIndistinct! and confusing!, within it exists things.\nObscure! and dark!, within it exists essence.\nIts essence is extremely real and true.\nWithin it exists truth.\n \nFrom the present, reaching to antiquity,\nIts name has not departed –\nThus I observe the father of the multitudes.\nHow do I thus know the father of the multitudes is like\n      this?\nBy means of this.",

    "23": "Chapter Twenty Three\n\nMinimal words are naturally so.\nTherefore : strong winds do not last the entire morning,         \nSudden rains do not last the entire day.\n \nWho makes these things?  Heaven and earth.\nEven heaven and earth can not maintain them forever,\nAnd so how much less can people?\n \nTherefore : of those who engage in Dao –\nHe who Daos is one with Dao.\nHe who Des is one with De.   \nHe who loses is one with the loss.\n \nFor he who is one with Dao,      \nDao is also pleased to have him.         \nFor he who is one with De,     \nDe is also pleased to have him.           \nFor he who is one with loss,   \nLoss is also pleased to have him.\n \nIf you do not trust enough, then you will not have\n      anyone’s trust.",
    "24": "Chapter Twenty Four\n\nHe who stands on tiptoe does not really stand.\nHe who stands astride can not travel.\nHe who displays himself does not have insight.\nHe who considers himself correct does not distinguish\n      himself.    \nHe who boasts about himself is without merit.\nHe who brags about himself does not endure.\n \nHe who lives in Dao –\nCalls these leftover food and unnecessary behavior.\nCreatures detest them, no matter what.\nTherefore : he who possesses Dao does not live by them.",
    "25": "Chapter Twenty Five\n\nSomething existed unformed yet complete,\nBefore heaven and earth were created.\nSilent!

    "26": "Chapter Twenty Six\n\nSerious serves as the source of frivolous.\nStillness serves as the ruler of restlessness.\n\nThus the noble man travels the entire day,\nAnd does not stray from his wagon.\nHe is serious, even though glorious sights and feasts\n      exist;\nHe lives above them, like this.\nSo how could one be the master of ten thousand chariots,\nAnd conduct his self frivolously in the world?    \n \nBe frivolous, then lose the source.\nBe restless, then lose the rulership.",

    "52": "Chapter Fifty Two\n\nThe world has a beginning; it is the mother to the world.\nBy knowing the mother, one knows her children.\nBy knowing the children, one returns to their mother.\nOne is without danger in life.\nStuffing channels to block portals [to avarice], one is without concern in life.\nOpening channels to facilitate contact [with avarice], one is without hope in life.\nSeeing the tiniest is discernment.\nHolding onto tenderness is strength.\nUse one's light, reflect upon one's discernment, leave nothing to one's regret.\nThis is Eternal Direction.",
    "53": "Chapter Fifty Three\n\nThis little I know:\nIn moving toward the Grand Direction, the only fear is moving astray.\nThe Grand Direction is straight forward; still, people go astray.\nThe court is not filled; the field is not tilled.\nStorehouses are empty, but gorgeous gowns are aplenty.\nBearing sharp swords, tired of exquisite boards,\nWith wealth to the burst, they are bandits at their worst.\nThis is not Direction.",
    "54": "Chapter Fifty Four\n\nWhat is well planted will not uproot;\nWhat is firmly held will not drop.\nDescendants will not discontinue remembrance ceremonies.\nCultivating it in self, virtue is true;\nCultivating it in the family, virtue overflows;\nCultivating it in the village, virtue lasts;\nCultivating it in the state, virtue is abundant;\nCultivating it in the world, virtue is universal.\nThus,\nlook at self through self;\nlook at the family through the family;\nlook at the village through the village;\nlook at the state through the state;\nlook at the world through the world.\nHow do I know the world?\nBecause it is so.",
    "55": "Chapter Fifty Five\n\nOne possessing virtue may be compared to an infant.\nPoisonous insects will not bite, ferocious animals will not pounce,\nFetching birds will not prey.\nThough weak in bones and soft in muscles, his hold is firm;\nThough ignorant of union, his instrument is turgid.\nThis is supreme energy.\nCrying all day without turning hoarse, this is supreme harmony.\nKnowing harmony is normalcy;\nknowing normalcy is discernment.\nEnriching oneself is ominous;\noverexerting oneself is ruinous.\nMatter withers after saturation;\nThis is not in line with Direction.\nNot in line with Direction, early demise is the expectation.",
    "56": "Chapter Fifty Six\n\nOne who knows is reticent; one who glibs is ignorant.\nStuff channels, block portals;\nblunt sharpness, resolve conflicts;\nharmonize brightness, mingle with dust.\nThis is the Profoundest Assimilation.\nThus, after gaining possession,\none does not patronize, nor slight, nor take advantage of, nor damage, nor treasure, nor debase.\nThus, one is treasured by the world.",
    "57": "Chapter Fifty Seven\n\nGovern a state with orthodoxy;\nfight a war with heterodoxy;\ntake the world with laissez-faire.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBecause:\nThe world is full of prohibitions, yet the populace is poor;\nPeople are stacked with weapons, yet the states are in turmoil;\nPeople are loaded with cleverness, yet strange schemes sprout;\nRules are stringent and well known, yet robbers and thieves abound.\nThus, the sage says:\nLet me practice laissez-faire, and the populace self-develop;\nLet me seek serenity, and the populace self-manage;\nLet me be without fanfare, and the populace self-prosper;\nLet me discard avarice, and the populace self-simplify.",
    "58": "Chapter Fifty Eight\n\nWhen policies are broad, the populace live simply;\nWhen policies are rigid, the populace complain roundly.\nFacing disaster, is fortune not in the wing?\nExperiencing fortune, is disaster not ready to spring?\nWho knows the limit?\nThere is no norm.\nOrthodoxy turns into heterodoxy, good turns into evil.\nPeople have been bewildered long.\nThus,\nthe sage is square without infringing upon others,\nfair without harming others,\nstraight without imposing upon others,\nbright without overshadowing others.",
    "59": "Chapter Fifty Nine\n\nIn governing people and in taking care of the cosmos, the best is restraint.\nWith restraint, one is ever ready.\nEver ready, one focuses on virtue.\nFocusing on virtue, one overcomes everything.\nOvercoming everything, one's limit does not come into being.\nWith one's limit not coming into being, one gains the state.\nHaving the foundation to governance, one lasts long.\nThis is deep root and solid foundation.\nThis is Direction - long lasting and long living.",
    "60": "Chapter Sixty\n\nGovern a large state is like frying a small fish.\nWith Direction embracing the world, ghosts become ineffective.\nIt is not because ghosts become ineffective;\nit is because their effect becomes inoffensive.\nNot only have ghosts become inoffensive;\nThe sage has also become inoffensive.\nWith the two not inflicting harm, the people are showered with virtue.",
    "61": "Chapter Sixty One\n\nA great nation is like a down-stream - the feminine to the world, the rendezvous of the world.\nThe feminine frequently wins over the masculine with serenity.\nSerenity is obsequiousness.\nThus,\na great nation, obsequious to a small nation, gains the small nation;\na small nation, obsequious to a great nation, gains the great nation.\nThus, one is obsequious in order to gain.\nOr, one is obsequious because it needs to gain.\nA great nation is not to be too keen on conquering.\nA small nation is not to be too keen on acquiescing.\nSince each gains what each desires, it is better for the great nation to be obsequious.",
    "62": "Chapter Sixty Two\n\nDirection,\nto myriad matters, is an enclosure;\nto people who are good, it is a treasure;\nto people who are not good, it can reassure.\nGood words gain people's respect;\ngood deeds gain people's admiration.\nWhy abandon people who are not good?\nThus, when a King is enthroned, three senior positions are filled.\nThough there are precious jades and speedy stallions, the best present is Direction.\nWhy, through the ages, is Direction so valued?\nIs it not because whoever seeks it gets it, and whoever is guilty, with it, receives amnesty?\nThat is why it is so valued by the world.",
    "63": "Chapter Sixty Three\n\nGovern with laissez-faire.\nAct without fanfare.\nDine with the commonest fare.\nBig begins as small; many accrue from few.\nIn tackling difficult tasks, first tackle those easy;\nIn tackling big tasks, first tackle those flimsy.\nThe difficult tasks of the world begin as easy;\nThe big tasks of the world begin as flimsy.\nThus, the sage, who never considers self big, completes many big tasks.\nThus,\npromise easily made leads to promise not fulfilled;\ndifficulty underestimated leads to difficulty multiplied.\nThus, the sage, in treating every task as difficult, encounters no difficulties.",
    "64": "Chapter Sixty Four\n\nGoverning is easy when there is peace;\nPlanning is easy when there is time;\nNipping is easy when buds are young;\nReconciling is easy when issues are minor.\nHandle matters before they come about;\nGovern people before there is chaos.\nA tree two-arms'-length wide grows from a seedling;\nA tower nine stories high starts with a spadeful;\nA journey a thousand miles long begins with a step.\nThe populace often fail when they are close to completing their tasks.\nBe as deliberate at the end as at the beginning; then, there can be no failure.\nThus, the sage desires what others do not desire, and places no premium on rare goods.\n[The sage] studies what others do not study,\nand revisits people's faults.\n[The sage] assists myriad matters to develop naturally but does not dare to interfere.",
    "65": "Chapter Sixty Five\n\nMen who knew Direction in olden days did not teach the populace to be clever, but teach them to be simple.\nA populace that is clever is difficult to govern.\nThus,\ngoverning with cleverness robs a state;\ngoverning not with cleverness benefits a state.\nOne who knows [the difference between] these two sets the standard.\nKnowing the standard at all times is Profoundest Virtue.\nProfoundest Virtue is deep; it is far.\nProfoundest Virtue returns matters to naturalness, to the Grand Gentleness.",
    "66": "Chapter Sixty Six\n\nThe sea is the king to hundreds of streams.\nBecause it is good at lying low, it can be the king to hundreds of streams.\nThus, a sage,\ndesirous of being the populace's superior, must be obsequious to them;\ndesirous of being in front of the populace, must follow them.\nThus, a sage,\nsitting high, in no way burdens the populace;\nstanding in front, in no way harms the populace.\nThus, the world is happy to support [the sage] and is not tired of doing so.\nBecause [the sage] is not in competition, the people in the world cannot engage him/her in competition.",
    "67": "Chapter Sixty Seven\n\nPeople in the world say that my Direction is grand as if without a referent.\nIt is because it is grand that Direction is without a referent.\nWere it capable of being referenced, it would not be grand.\nI have three treasures - embrace and safeguard them.\nOne, affection.\nTwo, restraint.\nThree, daring not to be at the front of [the people] of the world.\nWith affection, one becomes courageous;\nWith restraint, one becomes tolerant;\nDaring not to be at the front of the world, one is at the head.\nOne courts death if one\nforsakes affection for courage,\nforsakes restraint for tolerance,\nforsakes humility for prominence.\nWith affection,\nin war, one wins;\nin defense, strengthens.\nWhen cosmos comes to the rescue, it shields with affection.",
    "68": "Chapter Sixty Eight\n\nOne good at commandership does not easily use force,\none good at war is not easily provoked,\none good at winning does not easily engage in combat,\none good at deployment is obsequious.\nThis is the virtue of non-engagement; this is the ability at deployment.\nThis is fully consistent with the cosmos.",
    "69": "Chapter Sixty Nine\n\nA saying among warriors:\nI dare not play host, I prefer playing guest;\nI dare not advance an inch, I prefer retreating a foot.\nThis is formless formation,\nthis is defenseless advancement,\nthis is oppositionless encounter,\nthis is weaponless display.\nNo disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy.\nUnderestimating the enemy verges on losing my treasures.\nThus, when two equal-size armies are in combat, the one that is grieved wins.",
    "70": "Chapter Seventy\n\nMy words are easy to understand and easy to put into practice.\nBut no one in the world understands [my words], and no one puts them into practice.\nWords must be principled; actions must be justified.\nBecause these are not understood, I am not understood.\nWith few who understand me, fewer will put [my words] into practice.\nThus, a sage dresses simply but bears a jade.",
    "71": "Chapter Seventy One\n\nKnowing that one does not know is best;\nNot knowing but pretending to know is a fault.\nA sage has no faults, because he/she is aware of his/her faults and works on these faults.\nBecause a sage is aware of faults and works on them, he/she has no faults.",
    "72": "Chapter Seventy Two\n\nWhen the populace is unafraid of threats, major threats loom.\nDo not harass their neighborhood;\nDo not interfere with their livelihood.\nThus, without interference, people will not interfere.\nThus, the sage knows self without self-touting, respects self without self-aggrandizement.\nThus,\nforsake self-touting and self-aggrandizement;\nembrace self-knowledge and self-respect.",
    "73": "Chapter Seventy Three\n\nCourageous in accepting dare results in demise;\ncourageous in declining dare results in survival.\nBetween these two, there are advantages and disadvantages.\nThe cosmos has dislikes, but no one knows the reason.\nIt is hard even for the sage to explain.\nThe Direction of the cosmos,\nthough does not compete, is good at winning;\nthough wordless, is good at responding;\nneeds no invitation and comes on own volition;\nand is at ease and is good at planning.\nThe cosmos's net is immense; it is loose but it does not miss.",
    "74": "Chapter Seventy Four\n\nWhen the populace are unafraid of death, what good is threatening them with death?\nWhen the populace are afraid to die, hold devious ones and put them to death.\nAfter that, who dares?\nThe official executioner is always there to do executions.\nDoing executions by anyone else is like felling trees by other than an arborist.\nA non-arborist, in felling trees, is unlikely not to hurt his hands.",
    "75": "Chapter Seventy Five\n\nStarvation in the populace is caused by excessive taxes.\nExcessive taxes result in starvation.\nDifficulty in governing the populace is caused by a governor's interferences.\nInterferences result in difficulties in governance.\nIndifference to death in the populace is caused by a governor's overindulgence.\nA governor's overindulgence results in the populace's indifference to death.\nOne who does not overindulgence is wiser than one who overvalues one's life.",
    "76": "Chapter Seventy Six\n\nAt birth, one is soft and tender;\nat death, hard and stiff.\nAt the beginning, flora are tender and crisp;\nat the end, brittle and dry.\nThus, hardness and stiffness symbolize death; softness and tenderness, life.\nThus, an army, hard and stiff, is annihilated; a tree, hard and stiff, is cut.\nHard and stiff are inferior; soft and tender, superior.",
    "77": "Chapter Seventy Seven\n\nThe cosmos's Direction is like extending a bow.\nAiming too high, it lowers;\naiming too low, it raises.\nFrom the excessive, it takes;\nto the insufficient, it augments.\nThe cosmos's Direction is to take from the excessive and augment the insufficient.\nThis is not so for the direction in humans, which is to take from the insufficient to augment the excessive.\nWho is willing to augment [the insufficient of] the world with excesses?\nOnly ones with Direction.\nThus,\na sage provides without expecting approbation,\naccomplishes without seeking acclamation,\ndoes without flaunting wisdom.",
    "78": "Chapter Seventy Eight\n\nIn the world, nothing is softer and weaker than water, yet, in combating the strong, nothing can win over it.\nThere is nothing to replace it.\nThe weak wins over the strong; the tender wins over the steely.\nNo one in the world is unaware of it, yet no one follows it.\nThus, the sage says:\n\"One accepting a state's disgrace is worthy of being her governor;\none accepting the state's misfortunes is worthy of being the king to the world.\"\nRightful words appear paradoxical.",
    "79": "Chapter Seventy Nine\n\nSettling a major enmity, residual enmity remains.\nResponding enmity with virtue - how can this be good?\nThus, the sage holds the left half [of a promissory block] but does not demand payment.\nOne with virtue acts like that creditor;\none without virtue acts like the tax collector.\nThe cosmos's Direction does not play favoritism.\nIt [simply] provides people with goodness all the time.",
    "80": "Chapter Eighty\n\nSmall states.\nFew people.\nAll sorts of utensils, not in use.\nThe populace value death, unwilling to move.\nVehicles available, not in use.\nWeaponry available, not on display.\nTying knots for events.\nSuperbly governed.\nWell fed, beautifully clad, serenely housed, happily serenad'd.\nNeighboring states within sights.\nCrowing and barking heard across states.\nFrom birth to death, no interstate communication.",
    "81": "Chapter Eighty One\n\nSincere words are not pretty;\npretty words are not sincere.\nGood people are not argumentative;\nargumentative people are not good.\nLearned people are not erudite;\nerudite people are not learned.\nA sage does not hoard.\nThe more he/she provides, the more he/she is enriched;\nthe more he/she gives, the more he/she gains.\nThe cosmos's Direction is to facilitate and not harm;\nThe sage's Direction is to provide and not compete."
