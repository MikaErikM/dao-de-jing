        "3": "3\n\nDistractions\n\nPossessions may burden a relationship.\nThey distract, delude, and divide\ninstead of creating closeness and intimacy.\nThey create confusion and dissatisfaction\ninstead of peace and joy.\n\nQuiet your noisy mind.\nSimplify your busy life.\nReduce your many distractions\nso that you and your beloved\nmight live in deepest joy.\nConsider the things you have accumulated.\nDo they enhance your love\nand increase your intimacy?\nOr have they siphoned energy\nfrom the things you once knew to be important;\nwalks, talks, leisurely love-making, laughter, and play?",

        "7": "7\n\nAs Free as the Tao\n\nYou are free to be yourself\nin the presence of the Tao.\nThe Tao has no need for a particular response from you\nand is therefore free to be one with you.\nYou can be exactly as you are\nin the presence of your beloved\nfor the love between you is free\nof judgment and fear.\nYou do not cling to opinions or judgments.\nYou are each without agenda.\nYou are therefore as free as the Tao.\nCan you speak to each other of daily life\nwithout fear of criticism?\nCriticism is the cancer of relationships.\nIt feeds on healthy love\nand turns it to self-absorption.\nFind it early\nand cut it out!",

        "10": "10\n\nWorry Creates Walls\n\nKeep your thoughts from wandering\nto worries, frets, and fears.\nThis only makes your body rigid and tight,\nunavailable to your beloved.\nSeeing the world through your fears\ncreates walls.\nSeeing the world through your love\ncreates intimacy.\nWhen I am worried and fretful\nI protect myself by withdrawing.\nI retreat into my fearful thoughts\nas if by imagining the worst\nI somehow prepare for it.\nEveryone is left outside,\nincluding my beloved,\nwaiting for me to regain my senses.",

        "22": "Chapter 22\n\nAccommodate and be whole, bend and be straight;\nKeep low and be fulfilled, replace old and be new;\nSeek little and gain, seek plenty and be bewildered.\nThus, the sage embraces One to set an example for the people of the world.\nNot self-touting, one shines;\nNot self-justifying, one reassures;\nNot self-aggrandizing, one accomplishes;\nNot self-serving, one endures.\nWhen one is not in competition, people in the world cannot engage him/her in competition.\nIs the old saying \"Accommodate and be whole\" but empty words?\nIt can be realized fully.",
        "23": "Chapter 23\n\nTo be reticent is natural.\nThus, a whirlwind does not last all morning,\na downpour does not last all day.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause this is the universe.\nEven the universe cannot sustain; can humans?\nThus, one who follows Direction manages with Direction,\nOne who follows virtue manages with virtue,\nOne who does not follow Direction nor virtue manages with neither\nDirection nor virtue.\nOne who manages with Direction is welcome by those with Direction,\nOne who manages with virtue is welcome by those with virtue,\nOne who manages with neither Direction nor virtue is welcome by those without Direction or virtue.\nOne lacking in trustworthiness loses [the populace's] trust.",

        "26": "Chapter 26\n\nEarnestness is the foundation of frivolity;\nserenity is in control of rashness.\nThus, a gentleman, in the course of a day, does not depart from serenity and earnestness.\nHe refrains from extravagance [in public] and lives plainly at home.\nWhy would the sovereign of a ten-thousand-carriage state govern the world with frivolity?\nFrivolity loses foundation; rashness loses control.",

        "29": "Chapter 29\n\nOne who plans to govern the people in the world with coercion is,\nin my view, unlikely to succeed.\nThe people in the world are revered specimens,\nThey cannot be coerced; they cannot be dominated.\nOne who seeks to coerce is defeated;\nOne who seeks to dominate loses.\nThe sage practices laissez-faire.\nThus, the sage will not be defeated, the sage will not lose.\nAmong matters,\nsome lead and others follow;\nsome breathe slowly and others fast;\nsome are robust and others slim;\nsome play safe and others blast.\nThus,\nthe sage discards extremes, discards extravagances, discards excesses.",
        "30": "Chapter 30\n\nOne guided by Direction does not use military power to subdue the people in the world.\nIt boomerangs.\nWhere armies visit, thorns grow.\nAfter a great war, famines follow.\nOne who knows war stops after the objective is reached.\nHe dares not flaunt power.\nReach objective, but boast not;\nreach objective, but tout not;\nreach objective, but show arrogance not;\nReaching objective is because there is no alternative;\nReaching objective does not call for flaunting power.\nMatter withers after saturation.\nThis is not in line with Direction.\nNot in line with Direction, early demise is the expectation.",

        "32": "Chapter 32\n\nDirection frequently needs no name.\nIt is simple.\nIt is small.\nStill, it submits to nothing in the world.\nWere a Duke or a Prince to embrace Direction,\nmyriad matters would submit on own volition.\nWith the cosmos and the earth in harmony, sweet dew accrues.\nIt self-regulates without the need of intervention.\nAs the system begins, names are assigned.\nWhen names are assigned, know when to stop.\nKnowing when to stop averts danger.\nDirection in relation to people of the world is like the sea to rivers.",
        "33": "Chapter Thirty Three\n\nKnowing others is wisdom;\nknowing self is discernment.\nWinning over others shows prowess;\nwinning over self shows strength.\nWith contentment, one is wealthy.\nWith persistence, one shows determination.\nHolding on without losing ground, one is strong;\nDying without giving up Direction, one lives long.",
        "34": "Chapter Thirty Four\n\nThe Grand Direction permeates, left and right.\nWith myriad matters depending on it for growth, it declines none.\nAccomplishing much, it accepts no limelight.\nNurturing myriad matters without claiming, it may be labeled Small;\nReceiving myriad matters without claiming, it may be labeled Grand.\nBy not self-claiming Grand, it is thus Grand.",
        "35": "Chapter Thirty Five\n\nWhoever embraces the Grand Image attracts people in the world.\nAttracting but not discriminating, they live in peace.\nHearing music and seeing food, visitors linger.\nDirection, [as a subject] for discussion, is plain and flavorless.\nLooking at it, it is invisible;\nListening to it, it is inaudible;\nusing it, it is inexhaustible.",
        "36": "Chapter Thirty Six\n\nBefore contracting [an object], let it expand;\nBefore weakening [an object], let it solidify;\nBefore abandoning [an object], let it flourish;\nBefore seizing [an object], let it aggregate.\nThis is discernment at its micro best.\nTenderness overcomes bruteness.\nFish cannot survive away from water.\nA state does not boast her weaponry before the people.",
        "37": "Chapter Thirty Seven\n\nDirection is laissez-faire at all times; it is all-permeating.\nWere a Duke or a Prince to govern with Direction,\nMyriad matters would develop on own volition.\nAs self-development degenerates into avarice in complexity,\nI suppress it with Direction's simplicity.\nSuppressing with Direction's simplicity,\navarice disappears.\nWithout avarice, serenity visits with ease;\nThe world self-governs in peace.",
        "38": "Chapter Thirty Eight\n\nBy not displaying one's high virtue, one is virtuous;\nBy parading one's little virtue, one is not virtuous.\nOne with high virtue follows laissez-faire with carefree ease;\nOne with little virtue follows laissez-faire to parade one's virtue.\nOne with high nobleness practices nobleness with carefree ease;\nOne with high righteousness practices righteousness to parade one's righteousness.\nOne with high Conduct decrees;\nWith no followers, one uses force to twist others into following.\nThus,\nvirtue comes to the fore when Direction is not in evidence,\nnobleness comes to the fore when virtue is not in evidence,\nrighteousness comes to the fore when nobleness is not in evidence,\nConduct comes to the fore when righteousness is not in evidence.\nConduct comes to the fore when loyalty and trustworthiness lack;\nit brings about confusion.\nForeknowledge addresses but Direction's superficialities;\nit initiates folly.\nThus,\na great man seeks fullness, not lack;\nseeks substance, not facade.\nHe forsakes the latter [Conduct and foreknowledge] and accepts the former [loyalty, trustworthiness, and Direction].",

        "54": "Chapter Fifty Four\n\nWhat is well planted will not uproot;\nWhat is firmly held will not drop.\nDescendants will not discontinue remembrance ceremonies.\nCultivating it in self, virtue is true;\nCultivating it in the family, virtue overflows;\nCultivating it in the village, virtue lasts;\nCultivating it in the state, virtue is abundant;\nCultivating it in the world, virtue is universal.\nThus,\nlook at self through self;\nlook at the family through the family;\nlook at the village through the village;\nlook at the state through the state;\nlook at the world through the world.\nHow do I know the world?\nBecause it is so.",
        "55": "Chapter Fifty Five\n\nOne possessing virtue may be compared to an infant.\nPoisonous insects will not bite, ferocious animals will not pounce,\nFetching birds will not prey.\nThough weak in bones and soft in muscles, his hold is firm;\nThough ignorant of union, his instrument is turgid.\nThis is supreme energy.\nCrying all day without turning hoarse, this is supreme harmony.\nKnowing harmony is normalcy;\nknowing normalcy is discernment.\nEnriching oneself is ominous;\noverexerting oneself is ruinous.\nMatter withers after saturation;\nThis is not in line with Direction.\nNot in line with Direction, early demise is the expectation.",
        "56": "Chapter Fifty Six\n\nOne who knows is reticent; one who glibs is ignorant.\nStuff channels, block portals;\nblunt sharpness, resolve conflicts;\nharmonize brightness, mingle with dust.\nThis is the Profoundest Assimilation.\nThus, after gaining possession,\none does not patronize, nor slight, nor take advantage of, nor damage, nor treasure, nor debase.\nThus, one is treasured by the world.",
        "57": "Chapter Fifty Seven\n\nGovern a state with orthodoxy;\nfight a war with heterodoxy;\ntake the world with laissez-faire.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBecause:\nThe world is full of prohibitions, yet the populace is poor;\nPeople are stacked with weapons, yet the states are in turmoil;\nPeople are loaded with cleverness, yet strange schemes sprout;\nRules are stringent and well known, yet robbers and thieves abound.\nThus, the sage says:\nLet me practice laissez-faire, and the populace self-develop;\nLet me seek serenity, and the populace self-manage;\nLet me be without fanfare, and the populace self-prosper;\nLet me discard avarice, and the populace self-simplify.",

        "59": "Chapter Fifty Nine\n\nIn governing people and in taking care of the cosmos, the best is restraint.\nWith restraint, one is ever ready.\nEver ready, one focuses on virtue.\nFocusing on virtue, one overcomes everything.\nOvercoming everything, one's limit does not come into being.\nWith one's limit not coming into being, one gains the state.\nHaving the foundation to governance, one lasts long.\nThis is deep root and solid foundation.\nThis is Direction - long lasting and long living.",

        "61": "Chapter Sixty One\n\nA great nation is like a down-stream - the feminine to the world, the rendezvous of the world.\nThe feminine frequently wins over the masculine with serenity.\nSerenity is obsequiousness.\nThus,\na great nation, obsequious to a small nation, gains the small nation;\na small nation, obsequious to a great nation, gains the great nation.\nThus, one is obsequious in order to gain.\nOr, one is obsequious because it needs to gain.\nA great nation is not to be too keen on conquering.\nA small nation is not to be too keen on acquiescing.\nSince each gains what each desires, it is better for the great nation to be obsequious.",

        "63": "Chapter Sixty Three\n\nGovern with laissez-faire.\nAct without fanfare.\nDine with the commonest fare.\nBig begins as small; many accrue from few.\nIn tackling difficult tasks, first tackle those easy;\nIn tackling big tasks, first tackle those flimsy.\nThe difficult tasks of the world begin as easy;\nThe big tasks of the world begin as flimsy.\nThus, the sage, who never considers self big, completes many big tasks.\nThus,\npromise easily made leads to promise not fulfilled;\ndifficulty underestimated leads to difficulty multiplied.\nThus, the sage, in treating every task as difficult, encounters no difficulties.",

        "65": "Chapter Sixty Five\n\nMen who knew Direction in olden days did not teach the populace to be clever, but teach them to be simple.\nA populace that is clever is difficult to govern.\nThus,\ngoverning with cleverness robs a state;\ngoverning not with cleverness benefits a state.\nOne who knows [the difference between] these two sets the standard.\nKnowing the standard at all times is Profoundest Virtue.\nProfoundest Virtue is deep; it is far.\nProfoundest Virtue returns matters to naturalness, to the Grand Gentleness.",
        "66": "Chapter Sixty Six\n\nThe sea is the king to hundreds of streams.\nBecause it is good at lying low, it can be the king to hundreds of streams.\nThus, a sage,\ndesirous of being the populace's superior, must be obsequious to them;\ndesirous of being in front of the populace, must follow them.\nThus, a sage,\nsitting high, in no way burdens the populace;\nstanding in front, in no way harms the populace.\nThus, the world is happy to support [the sage] and is not tired of doing so.\nBecause [the sage] is not in competition, the people in the world cannot engage him/her in competition.",
        "67": "Chapter Sixty Seven\n\nPeople in the world say that my Direction is grand as if without a referent.\nIt is because it is grand that Direction is without a referent.\nWere it capable of being referenced, it would not be grand.\nI have three treasures - embrace and safeguard them.\nOne, affection.\nTwo, restraint.\nThree, daring not to be at the front of [the people] of the world.\nWith affection, one becomes courageous;\nWith restraint, one becomes tolerant;\nDaring not to be at the front of the world, one is at the head.\nOne courts death if one\nforsakes affection for courage,\nforsakes restraint for tolerance,\nforsakes humility for prominence.\nWith affection,\nin war, one wins;\nin defense, strengthens.\nWhen cosmos comes to the rescue, it shields with affection.",
        "68": "Chapter Sixty Eight\n\nOne good at commandership does not easily use force,\none good at war is not easily provoked,\none good at winning does not easily engage in combat,\none good at deployment is obsequious.\nThis is the virtue of non-engagement; this is the ability at deployment.\nThis is fully consistent with the cosmos.",
        "69": "Chapter Sixty Nine\n\nA saying among warriors:\nI dare not play host, I prefer playing guest;\nI dare not advance an inch, I prefer retreating a foot.\nThis is formless formation,\nthis is defenseless advancement,\nthis is oppositionless encounter,\nthis is weaponless display.\nNo disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy.\nUnderestimating the enemy verges on losing my treasures.\nThus, when two equal-size armies are in combat, the one that is grieved wins.",

        "75": "Chapter Seventy Five\n\nStarvation in the populace is caused by excessive taxes.\nExcessive taxes result in starvation.\nDifficulty in governing the populace is caused by a governor's interferences.\nInterferences result in difficulties in governance.\nIndifference to death in the populace is caused by a governor's overindulgence.\nA governor's overindulgence results in the populace's indifference to death.\nOne who does not overindulgence is wiser than one who overvalues one's life.",
        "76": "Chapter Seventy Six\n\nAt birth, one is soft and tender;\nat death, hard and stiff.\nAt the beginning, flora are tender and crisp;\nat the end, brittle and dry.\nThus, hardness and stiffness symbolize death; softness and tenderness, life.\nThus, an army, hard and stiff, is annihilated; a tree, hard and stiff, is cut.\nHard and stiff are inferior; soft and tender, superior.",
        "77": "Chapter Seventy Seven\n\nThe cosmos's Direction is like extending a bow.\nAiming too high, it lowers;\naiming too low, it raises.\nFrom the excessive, it takes;\nto the insufficient, it augments.\nThe cosmos's Direction is to take from the excessive and augment the insufficient.\nThis is not so for the direction in humans, which is to take from the insufficient to augment the excessive.\nWho is willing to augment [the insufficient of] the world with excesses?\nOnly ones with Direction.\nThus,\na sage provides without expecting approbation,\naccomplishes without seeking acclamation,\ndoes without flaunting wisdom.",
