        "1": "Direction, as expressed, is no ordinary direction;\nas named, no ordinary name.\nNull identifies the universe at the beginning.\nUll identifies the mother of myriad matters.\nThus, visit Null to observe its intricateness.\nVisit Ull to observe its limitlessness.\nThese two spring from the same source;\nonly their identifications differ.\nBoth are profound.\nProfound upon profound, it is the portal to all intricacies.",
        "2": "For [people in] the world to know [only] beauty and what is beautiful is ugly;\nto know [only] goodness and what is good is not good.\nUll and Null complement in generation,\ndifficult and easy complement in completion;\nlong and short complement in form,\nhigh and low complement in norm;\nvoice and sound complement in harmony,\nfront and rear complement in company;\n- they are ever so.\nThus,\na sage practices laissez-faire governance and provides wordless instructions.\n[A sage] neither interferes with myriad matters' generation,\nnor takes possession of [their] cultivation,\nnor expects approbation of [his/her] provision,\nnor seeks acclamation for [their] accomplishments.\nIt is because [the sage] does not seek acclamation for [his/her] accomplishments that they do not disappear.",
        "3": "Where admiration is not bestowed upon the wise,\nthe populace will not compete for recognition.\nWhere premium is not placed on rare goods,\nthe populace will not engage in robbery.\nWhere desirable items are not on display,\nthe populace will not be tempted.\nThus,\nthe sage governs by cleansing [the populace's] hearts,\nfilling their stomachs,\ntaming their will,\nand strengthening their bodies\n- to induce the populace, in time, not to indulge in knowledge nor to cultivate avarice.\nSo prepared, those with wisdom dare not offer schemes, and laissez-faire governance follows.\nWith that, no affair is beyond governance.",
        "4": "Direction is the hollow.\nRegardless of use, it is inexhaustible.\nSo unfathomable, as if the source of all matters.\nSo deep, as if it exists.\nI do not know whose offspring Direction is;\nit precedes kings.",
        "5": "The universe is ignoble; it regards myriad matters as straw dogs.\nThe sage is ignoble; he/she regards the gentry as straw dogs.\nIs the universe not a wind tunnel?\nInexhaustible at rest; dynamic at its fiercest.\nMore rules yield faster demise.\nLaissez-faire is a better device.",
        "6": "The valley is undying.\nIt is the mystical womb.\nThe portal to the mystical womb is the root of the cosmos.\nContinuous and unterminable, its use is inexhaustible.",
        "7": "The cosmos is long.\nThe earth is lasting.\nThe reason the cosmos is long and the earth lasting is that they exist not for self-perpetuation.\nUnconcerned with self-perpetuation, they perpetuate.\nThus, the sage,\nby queuing himself/herself behind others, ends in being ahead;\nby being unconcerned, endures.\nIs it not so that the sage, without self-interest, satisfies his/her self-interest?",
        "8": "Goodness at its best is like water.\nWater benefits myriad matters but is not in competition with them.\nWater stays at a level disliked by others, as if it were the Direction.\nWherever [the sage] stays, it is a good place;\nwhatever [the sage] thinks, it is good thought;\nwhomever [the sage] contacts, it is nobleness;\nwhatever [the sage] expresses, it is truthfulness;\nhowever [the sage] governs, it is good administration;\nwhatever [the sage] does, it is good deed;\nwhenever [the sage] acts, it is timely action.\nBeing not in competition, [the sage] has no concern.",
        "9": "Filling to the brim is not as good as stopping short;\nPolishing to the sharpest does not last long.\nA roomful of gold and jade is hard to follow.\nOne prideful of wealth and fame sows the seeds of sorrow.\nWith mission accomplished, it is time to offer resignation.\nThis is cosmos's Direction.",
        "10": "Unite physically and mentally to embrace One.\nCan one be not separated from it?\nChannel energy toward tenderness.\nCan one emulate the infant?\nCleanse the deep mirror within.\nCan one be without blemishes?\nLove the populace in governance.\nCan one practice laissez-faire?\nOpen and close the cosmic portal.\nCan one assume the feminine role?\nDiscern and deliberate.\nCan one be ignorant?\nCultivate, rear.\nCultivate, but possess not;\nProvide, but claim not;\nNurture, but dominate not.\nThis is the Profoundest virtue.",
        "11": "Thirty spokes share one hub.\nThe hollow in the hub expresses the carriage's usefulness.\nWith clay, a vessel is molded.\nThe hollow within expresses the vessel's usefulness.\nWith doors and windows, a room is formed.\nThe hollow within expresses the room's usefulness.\nThus, visible provides the facility; hollow expresses its usefulness.",
        "12": "Five colors blind the eye;\nFive tones deafen the ear;\nFive flavors dull the palate.\nPrancing and hunting render one restless;\nRare goods render one senseless.\nThus,\na sage aims at the stomach and not at the eye, discarding the latter in favor of the former.",
        "13": "Receiving favor and receiving disgrace are both causes for concern,\nmore so than being visited by a catastrophic disease.\nWhy are favors and disgraces causes for concern?\nFavor is beneath one.\nReceiving it is a cause for concern; losing it is a cause for concern.\nWhy [favors and disgraces] are more a cause for concern than being visited by a catastrophic disease?\nWhen I have a catastrophic disease,\nit is inflicted upon my body.\nWhen I am beyond my body, how can I be visited by diseases?\nThus,\nwhen one values one's body for the good of the world,\none may be consigned with the world's care.\nWhen one treasures one's body for the good of the world,\none may be vested with the world's care.",
        "14": "Looking at it, it cannot be seen - label it invisible,\nListening to it, it cannot be heard - label it inaudible,\nHolding onto it, it cannot be held - label it intangible.\nAll three are beyond comprehension; they are One.\nLooking up, it is dim.\nLooking down, it is dark.\nIt lacks clarity,\nit defies a name;\nit returns to Null.\nThis is formless form, this is imageless image.\nThis is elusiveness.\nConfronting it, one cannot see its head;\nFollowing it, one cannot see its tail.\nSeize Direction of the past - this is to manage the Ull of the present.\nKnow it from the beginning - this is to understand the Direction's rhythm.",
        "15": "One who understood Direction in olden days knew the tiniest, appreciated the profoundest, and was deep beyond [our] comprehension.\nSince such a person is beyond [our] comprehension, he/she can only be described superficially:\nas deliberate as approaching a deep channel in the winter,\nas alert as keeping watch over bordering states,\nas diplomatic as an envoy in presenting,\nas graceful as ice in slow melting,\nas simple as a block of uncarved wood,\nas calm as a valley's mood,\nas accommodating as muddy water,\nas expansive as the sea,\nas unending as the wind.\nWho can calm the muddy to let it distill?\nWho can motivate the serene to let it instill?\nOne who understands Direction never fills to the brim.\nNot filled to the brim,\none is at ready to remove the old and substitute it with new.",
        "16": "Aim at the supreme hollow, reach for the utmost serenity.\nMatters bloom in myriad diversity.\nI watch for periodicity.\nMatters blossom and return to their roots.\nReturning to roots leads to serenity.\nSerenity leads to regeneration.\nRegeneration leads to normalcy.\nKnowing normalcy leads to comprehension.\nNot knowing normalcy, indiscretion leads to misfortune.\nKnowing normalcy is all-accommodating;\nAll-accommodating is non-discriminating.\nNon-discriminating is all-encompassing.\nAll-encompassing is the cosmos.\nCosmos is Direction.\nDirection is long lasting.\n[One who follows Direction] is unlikely to encounter danger throughout life.",
        "17": "At the highest level, one is unseen.\nAt the next level, one is liked and praised.\nAt the next level, one is feared.\nAt the next level, one is ridiculed.\nOne lacking in trustworthiness loses the [populace's] trust.\nCarefree, one values one's words.\nWith work accomplished and business done, the gentry say: \"We do this naturally.\"",
        "18": "When Grand Direction is not in evidence,\nnobleness and righteousness come to the fore.\nWhen cleverness and glibness are in view,\ngrand pretenses come to the fore.\nWhen family relations are in disharmony,\nfiliality and parental love come to the fore.\nWhen a state is in disarray,\nloyal ministers come to the fore.",
        "19": "Renounce saintliness, shun cleverness - let the populace be better off by a hundredfold.\nRenounce nobleness, shun righteousness - let the populace return to filiality and parental love.\nRenounce scheming, shun profiteering - let robbers and thieves vanish.\nThe three are inadequate formulation.\nBetter channel [the populace] to Direction.\nWelcome purity, embrace simplicity;\nMinimize self-interest, reduce desire.\nRenounce learning, eliminate apprehension.",
        "20": "Between obsequiousness and authoritativeness - what is the difference?\nBetween beauty and ugliness - is there a difference?\nWhat others fear, do not be unfearful.\nUncultivated, it is because it is unfinished.\nOther people are happily gathered, as if readying to partake in an exquisite banquet, to view a spring parade.\nI stand alone, quietly, inconspicuously.\nInnocently, as if an infant not knowing how to smile;\nAimlessly, as if a wanderer not knowing where to go.\nOther people have much to spare;\nI, alone, am bare.\nPerhaps my foolish heart.\nCommon people glow;\nI, alone, am in the dark.\nCommon people are alert;\nI, alone, am stark.\nOther people are skillful;\nI, alone, am clumsy and bashful.\nI am different from others;\nI treasure being embraced by Mother.",
        "21": "The Grand Virtue's complexion resembles that of Direction.\nDirection, as a matter substantive,\nis sometimes indistinct and other times elusive.\nElusive and indistinct, there is image within;\nIndistinct and elusive, there is matter within.\nMinuscule and mysterious, there are particles within;\nThese particles are real; there is reality within.\nFrom the present back to the past, its name is never unacknowledged;\nit is the foundation of all matters.\nHow do I know that it is the foundation of all matters?\nThrough Direction.",
        "22": "Accommodate and be whole, bend and be straight;\nKeep low and be fulfilled, replace old and be new;\nSeek little and gain, seek plenty and be bewildered.\nThus, the sage embraces One to set an example for the people of the world.\nNot self-touting, one shines;\nNot self-justifying, one reassures;\nNot self-aggrandizing, one accomplishes;\nNot self-serving, one endures.\nWhen one is not in competition, people in the world cannot engage him/her in competition.\nIs the old saying \"Accommodate and be whole\" but empty words?\nIt can be realized fully.",
        "23": "To be reticent is natural.\nThus, a whirlwind does not last all morning,\na downpour does not last all day.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause this is the universe.\nEven the universe cannot sustain; can humans?\nThus, one who follows Direction manages with Direction,\nOne who follows virtue manages with virtue,\nOne who does not follow Direction nor virtue manages with neither\nDirection nor virtue.\nOne who manages with Direction is welcome by those with Direction,\nOne who manages with virtue is welcome by those with virtue,\nOne who manages with neither Direction nor virtue is welcome by those without Direction or virtue.\nOne lacking in trustworthiness loses [the populace's] trust.",
        "24": "One who tiptoes to stand taller does not stand firm;\nOne who strides to walk faster does not walk long;\nOne who self-touts does not shine;\nOne who self-justifies does not reassure;\nOne who self-aggrandizes does not accomplish;\nOne who self-serves does not endure.\nThey, in relation to Direction, are the equivalent of leftover food and excess fat.\nThey are unattractive;\nthey are not held by those with Direction.",
        "25": "A matter is molded;\nit comes into being before the universe, noiseless and formless.\nIt stands by itself, unwaveringly;\nit is in motion, unendingly.\nIt may be the Mother to the universe.\nI do not know its name.\nTentatively, [I] label it Direction and call it Grand.\nGrand is unending motion;\nunending motion is far-reaching;\nFar-reaching is periodicity.\nThus,\nDirection is grand,\nthe cosmos is grand,\nthe earth is grand,\nthe human is also grand.\nThere are four Grands in the universe, and the human is one of them.\nThe human follows the earth,\nThe earth follows the cosmos,\nThe cosmos follows Direction,\nDirection follows Nature.",
        "26": "Earnestness is the foundation of frivolity;\nserenity is in control of rashness.\nThus, a gentleman, in the course of a day, does not depart from serenity and earnestness.\nHe refrains from extravagance [in public] and lives plainly at home.\nWhy would the sovereign of a ten-thousand-carriage state govern the world with frivolity?\nFrivolity loses foundation; rashness loses control.",
        "27": "A good traveler leaves no trails;\nA good speaker allows no slips;\nA good planner needs no tallies;\nA good carpenter needs no bolts in securing a door from opening;\nA good packager needs no strings in preventing a knot from untying.\nThus,\nthe sage cares for everyone and abandons no one,\ncares for everything and abandons nothing.\nThis is unrevealed wisdom.\nThus,\na good person serves as the teacher to a not-so-good person;\na not-so-good person serves as the mirror to a good person.\nOne who neither respects one's teacher nor cares for one's mirror, even if wise, will be bewildered.\nThis is the innermost intricacy.",
        "28": "Know steeliness, but prefer tenderness.\nBe the brook to the world.\nThe brook to the world is never disunited from virtue.\nIt aims to return to infancy.\nKnow limelight, but prefer shadow.\nBe the standard to the world.\nThe standard to the world never deviates from virtue.\nIt aims to return to the Infinite.\nKnow fame, but prefer humility.\nBe the valley to the world.\nThe valley to the world is filled with virtue.\nIt aims to return to simplicity.\nSimplicity dissipates when [a block] is carved into a vessel.\nA sage diminishes when [he/she] is used as a leader.\nThus, a great system is not cut up.",
        "29": "One who plans to govern the people in the world with coercion is,\nin my view, unlikely to succeed.\nThe people in the world are revered specimens,\nThey cannot be coerced; they cannot be dominated.\nOne who seeks to coerce is defeated;\nOne who seeks to dominate loses.\nThe sage practices laissez-faire.\nThus, the sage will not be defeated, the sage will not lose.\nAmong matters,\nsome lead and others follow;\nsome breathe slowly and others fast;\nsome are robust and others slim;\nsome play safe and others blast.\nThus,\nthe sage discards extremes, discards extravagances, discards excesses.",
        "30": "One guided by Direction does not use military power to subdue the people in the world.\nIt boomerangs.\nWhere armies visit, thorns grow.\nAfter a great war, famines follow.\nOne who knows war stops after the objective is reached.\nHe dares not flaunt power.\nReach objective, but boast not;\nreach objective, but tout not;\nreach objective, but show arrogance not;\nReaching objective is because there is no alternative;\nReaching objective does not call for flaunting power.\nMatter withers after saturation.\nThis is not in line with Direction.\nNot in line with Direction, early demise is the expectation.",
        "31": "Weaponry are not instruments of the good;\nthey are disliked by everyone.\nOne with Direction does not harbor them.\nA gentleman,\nat home, takes the left position;\nin war, the right position.\nWeaponry are not instruments of the good;\nthey are not a gentleman's instruments.\nUse them only because there is no alternative;\nuse them with restraint.\nAfter victory, beautify it not.\nOne who beautifies [war] is one who delights in killing.\nOne who delights in killing is unfit to be entrusted with people of the world.\nOn celebratory occasions, prefer left;\nOn sad occasions, prefer right.\nThe adjutant stays left;\nthe commander-in-chief stays right.\nThus, treat war as funeral.\nThose who have killed, return with remorse.\nTreat victory as funeral.",
        "32": "Direction frequently needs no name.\nIt is simple.\nIt is small.\nStill, it submits to nothing in the world.\nWere a Duke or a Prince to embrace Direction,\nmyriad matters would submit on own volition.\nWith the cosmos and the earth in harmony, sweet dew accrues.\nIt self-regulates without the need of intervention.\nAs the system begins, names are assigned.\nWhen names are assigned, know when to stop.\nKnowing when to stop averts danger.\nDirection in relation to people of the world is like the sea to rivers.",
        "33": "Knowing others is wisdom;\nknowing self is discernment.\nWinning over others shows prowess;\nwinning over self shows strength.\nWith contentment, one is wealthy.\nWith persistence, one shows determination.\nHolding on without losing ground, one is strong;\nDying without giving up Direction, one lives long.",
        "34": "The Grand Direction permeates, left and right.\nWith myriad matters depending on it for growth, it declines none.\nAccomplishing much, it accepts no limelight.\nNurturing myriad matters without claiming, it may be labeled Small;\nReceiving myriad matters without claiming, it may be labeled Grand.\nBy not self-claiming Grand, it is thus Grand.",
        "35": "Whoever embraces the Grand Image attracts people in the world.\nAttracting but not discriminating, they live in peace.\nHearing music and seeing food, visitors linger.\nDirection, [as a subject] for discussion, is plain and flavorless.\nLooking at it, it is invisible;\nListening to it, it is inaudible;\nusing it, it is inexhaustible.",
        "36": "Before contracting [an object], let it expand;\nBefore weakening [an object], let it solidify;\nBefore abandoning [an object], let it flourish;\nBefore seizing [an object], let it aggregate.\nThis is discernment at its micro best.\nTenderness overcomes bruteness.\nFish cannot survive away from water.\nA state does not boast her weaponry before the people.",
        "37": "Direction is laissez-faire at all times; it is all-permeating.\nWere a Duke or a Prince to govern with Direction,\nMyriad matters would develop on own volition.\nAs self-development degenerates into avarice in complexity,\nI suppress it with Direction's simplicity.\nSuppressing with Direction's simplicity,\navarice disappears.\nWithout avarice, serenity visits with ease;\nThe world self-governs in peace.",
        "38": "By not displaying one's high virtue, one is virtuous;\nBy parading one's little virtue, one is not virtuous.\nOne with high virtue follows laissez-faire with carefree ease;\nOne with little virtue follows laissez-faire to parade one's virtue.\nOne with high nobleness practices nobleness with carefree ease;\nOne with high righteousness practices righteousness to parade one's righteousness.\nOne with high Conduct decrees;\nWith no followers, one uses force to twist others into following.\nThus,\nvirtue comes to the fore when Direction is not in evidence,\nnobleness comes to the fore when virtue is not in evidence,\nrighteousness comes to the fore when nobleness is not in evidence,\nConduct comes to the fore when righteousness is not in evidence.\nConduct comes to the fore when loyalty and trustworthiness lack;\nit brings about confusion.\nForeknowledge addresses but Direction's superficialities;\nit initiates folly.\nThus,\na great man seeks fullness, not lack;\nseeks substance, not facade.\nHe forsakes the latter [Conduct and foreknowledge] and accepts the former [loyalty, trustworthiness, and Direction].",
        "39": "Among those with One in the past:\nThe cosmos, with One, produced cleanliness;\nThe earth, with One, produced calmness;\nA shen, with One, produced responsiveness;\nThe valley, with One, produced fullness;\nMyriad matters, with One, generated;\nA Duke or Prince, with One, at the center of the world was seated.\nExtending,\nThe cosmos, without One and without cleanliness, would be separated;\nThe earth, without One and without calmness, would be barren;\nA shen, without One and without responsiveness, would be deserted;\nThe valley, without One and without fullness, would be depleted;\nMyriad matters, without One and without growth, would stall;\nDukes and princes, without One and without being in the center, would fall.\nThus,\nhumbleness is the root of esteem;\nlowness is the foundation of height.\nThus,\na Duke or Prince calls himself My Loneliness, The Isolated Person, The Ungracious Person.\nIs this not humbleness as the root of esteem?\nIs it not so?\nThus, the supreme honor requires no honor.\nAim not at jade's attractiveness, but at rock's solidness.",
        "40": "Periodicity is Direction in motion;\nFrailty is Direction in application.\nMyriad matters in the world are born out of Ull.\nUll is born out of Null.",
        "41": "Hearing Direction,\na scholar with high intelligence follows it with diligence;\na scholar with average intelligence greets it with mixed seriousness and doubt;\na scholar with low intelligence ridicules it.\nDirection will not be Direction without being ridiculed.\nIt is said:\nA bright Direction appears unilluminating;\nAn advancing Direction appears retreating;\nA straight-forward Direction appears uninviting;\nHighest virtue appears as valley impoverished;\nPurest white appears blemished;\nBroadest virtue appears diminished;\nStrong virtue appears slack;\nFine quality appears flawed;\nThe supreme square has no corners;\nThe supreme vessel is cast last;\nThe supreme sound is inaudible;\nThe supreme image is formless.\nDirection is unrevealed and anonymous.\nThrough Direction, help is given and work is completed.",
        "42": "From Direction, One is born.\nFrom One, Two is born.\nFrom Two, Three is born.\nFrom Three, myriad matters are born.\nMyriad matters turn their backs on yin and embrace yang.\nThe complement of their energy produces harmony.\nWhat people dislike are loneliness, isolation, and ungraciousness,\nyet this is how Dukes and Princes self-address.\nThus, a matter expands through contraction;\ncontracts through expansion.\nThis is what others have taught me;\nlet me teach others the same: \"A violent person does not die in place.\"\nThis is the theme of my teaching.",
        "43": "The world's tenderest is the master of the world's steeliest.\nNull permeates Ull.\nI thus know the benefits of laissez-faire.\nInstructions without words and benefits of laissez-faire - few things in the world can top them.",
        "44": "Fame and health - which is dearer?\nHealth and wealth - which is more valuable?\nGain and loss - which is more damaging?\nExcessive love demands large outlay.\nOverabundant wealth results in heavy loss.\nThus,\nknowing contentment brings about no disgrace;\nknowing moderation brings about no danger.\nOne lasts long.",
        "45": "Great Perfection appears flawed; its use is endless.\nGreat Fullness appears less; its use is limitless.\nGreat Straightness appears warped,\nGreat Dexteriousness appears handicapped,\nGreat Eloquence appears reticent.\nSerenity wins over rashness; coolness wins over heatedness.\nSerenity governs the world.",
        "46": "When the world is governed by Direction, horses haul manure.\nWhen the world is not governed by Direction, mares foal near [war] location.\nNo calamity is greater than not being content;\nNo fault is greater than the desire to gain at any cost.\nThus, one who is content in being content is always content.",
        "47": "Without leaving home, one knows the world;\nWithout looking through the window, one discerns the cosmos's Direction.\nThe farther one moves about, the less one knows.\nThus,\nthe sage knows without moving about,\ndiscerns without looking through the window,\naccomplishes with laissez-faire.",
        "48": "Aiming at study, one's avarice gains day by day;\nAiming at Direction, one's avarice loses day by day.\nLosing [avarice] upon losing [avarice], one ends with laissez-faire.\nLaissez-faire permeates everything.\nTo govern the world, one always practices laissez-faire.\nWithout laissez-faire, one is unfit to govern the world.",
        "49": "The sage has no preconceived notion at any time;\nthe people's notion is the sage's notion.\nI treat a person, who is good, well;\nI treat a person, who is not good, also well.\nThis is for goodness's sake.\nI trust a person who is worthy of trust;\nI also trust a person who is not worthy of trust.\nThis is for trustworthiness's sake.\nThe sage, in governing the world, holds back personal notions in favor of the people's.\nThe sage treats the people, focusing on themselves, as infants.",
        "50": "People are born and people die.\nThree in ten live long;\nThree in ten die young;\nThree in ten move [prematurely] into death's realm.\nWhy so?\nBecause they care for their lives too well.\nThose who care for themselves, it is said, are unlikely to encounter rhinoceroses or tigers on land, or face weaponry and soldiers in war.\nRhinoceroses have no occasion to use their horns;\ntigers have no occasion to use their claws;\nsoldiers have no occasion to use their bayonets.\nWhy so?\nBecause they care for themselves to not move into death's realm.",
        "51": "Cultivated by Direction, reared by virtue;\nformed by matter, completed by interaction.\nThus, myriad matters revere Direction and value virtue.\nThe reason Direction is revered and virtue valued is that they do not command but let myriad matters visit Nature.\nThus,\nDirection cultivates,\nvirtue rears, nurtures, guides, comforts, protects, cares, shelters.\nCultivating without possessing,\nproviding without claiming,\nnurturing without dominating,\nThis is the Profoundest Virtue.",
        "52": "The world has a beginning; it is the mother to the world.\nBy knowing the mother, one knows her children.\nBy knowing the children, one returns to their mother.\nOne is without danger in life.\nStuffing channels to block portals [to avarice], one is without concern in life.\nOpening channels to facilitate contact [with avarice], one is without hope in life.\nSeeing the tiniest is discernment.\nHolding onto tenderness is strength.\nUse one's light, reflect upon one's discernment, leave nothing to one's regret.\nThis is Eternal Direction.",
        "53": "This little I know:\nIn moving toward the Grand Direction, the only fear is moving astray.\nThe Grand Direction is straight forward; still, people go astray.\nThe court is not filled; the field is not tilled.\nStorehouses are empty, but gorgeous gowns are aplenty.\nBearing sharp swords, tired of exquisite boards,\nWith wealth to the burst, they are bandits at their worst.\nThis is not Direction.",
        "54": "What is well planted will not uproot;\nWhat is firmly held will not drop.\nDescendants will not discontinue remembrance ceremonies.\nCultivating it in self, virtue is true;\nCultivating it in the family, virtue overflows;\nCultivating it in the village, virtue lasts;\nCultivating it in the state, virtue is abundant;\nCultivating it in the world, virtue is universal.\nThus,\nlook at self through self;\nlook at the family through the family;\nlook at the village through the village;\nlook at the state through the state;\nlook at the world through the world.\nHow do I know the world?\nBecause it is so.",
        "55": "One possessing virtue may be compared to an infant.\nPoisonous insects will not bite, ferocious animals will not pounce,\nFetching birds will not prey.\nThough weak in bones and soft in muscles, his hold is firm;\nThough ignorant of union, his instrument is turgid.\nThis is supreme energy.\nCrying all day without turning hoarse, this is supreme harmony.\nKnowing harmony is normalcy;\nknowing normalcy is discernment.\nEnriching oneself is ominous;\noverexerting oneself is ruinous.\nMatter withers after saturation;\nThis is not in line with Direction.\nNot in line with Direction, early demise is the expectation.",
        "56": "One who knows is reticent; one who glibs is ignorant.\nStuff channels, block portals;\nblunt sharpness, resolve conflicts;\nharmonize brightness, mingle with dust.\nThis is the Profoundest Assimilation.\nThus, after gaining possession,\none does not patronize, nor slight, nor take advantage of, nor damage, nor treasure, nor debase.\nThus, one is treasured by the world.",
        "57": "Govern a state with orthodoxy;\nfight a war with heterodoxy;\ntake the world with laissez-faire.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBecause:\nThe world is full of prohibitions, yet the populace is poor;\nPeople are stacked with weapons, yet the states are in turmoil;\nPeople are loaded with cleverness, yet strange schemes sprout;\nRules are stringent and well known, yet robbers and thieves abound.\nThus, the sage says:\nLet me practice laissez-faire, and the populace self-develop;\nLet me seek serenity, and the populace self-manage;\nLet me be without fanfare, and the populace self-prosper;\nLet me discard avarice, and the populace self-simplify.",
        "58": "When policies are broad, the populace live simply;\nWhen policies are rigid, the populace complain roundly.\nFacing disaster, is fortune not in the wing?\nExperiencing fortune, is disaster not ready to spring?\nWho knows the limit?\nThere is no norm.\nOrthodoxy turns into heterodoxy, good turns into evil.\nPeople have been bewildered long.\nThus,\nthe sage is square without infringing upon others,\nfair without harming others,\nstraight without imposing upon others,\nbright without overshadowing others.",
        "59": "In governing people and in taking care of the cosmos, the best is restraint.\nWith restraint, one is ever ready.\nEver ready, one focuses on virtue.\nFocusing on virtue, one overcomes everything.\nOvercoming everything, one's limit does not come into being.\nWith one's limit not coming into being, one gains the state.\nHaving the foundation to governance, one lasts long.\nThis is deep root and solid foundation.\nThis is Direction - long lasting and long living.",
        "60": "Govern a large state is like frying a small fish.\nWith Direction embracing the world, ghosts become ineffective.\nIt is not because ghosts become ineffective;\nit is because their effect becomes inoffensive.\nNot only have ghosts become inoffensive;\nThe sage has also become inoffensive.\nWith the two not inflicting harm, the people are showered with virtue.",
        "61": "A great nation is like a down-stream - the feminine to the world, the rendezvous of the world.\nThe feminine frequently wins over the masculine with serenity.\nSerenity is obsequiousness.\nThus,\na great nation, obsequious to a small nation, gains the small nation;\na small nation, obsequious to a great nation, gains the great nation.\nThus, one is obsequious in order to gain.\nOr, one is obsequious because it needs to gain.\nA great nation is not to be too keen on conquering.\nA small nation is not to be too keen on acquiescing.\nSince each gains what each desires, it is better for the great nation to be obsequious.",
        "62": "Direction,\nto myriad matters, is an enclosure;\nto people who are good, it is a treasure;\nto people who are not good, it can reassure.\nGood words gain people's respect;\ngood deeds gain people's admiration.\nWhy abandon people who are not good?\nThus, when a King is enthroned, three senior positions are filled.\nThough there are precious jades and speedy stallions, the best present is Direction.\nWhy, through the ages, is Direction so valued?\nIs it not because whoever seeks it gets it, and whoever is guilty, with it, receives amnesty?\nThat is why it is so valued by the world.",
        "63": "Govern with laissez-faire.\nAct without fanfare.\nDine with the commonest fare.\nBig begins as small; many accrue from few.\nIn tackling difficult tasks, first tackle those easy;\nIn tackling big tasks, first tackle those flimsy.\nThe difficult tasks of the world begin as easy;\nThe big tasks of the world begin as flimsy.\nThus, the sage, who never considers self big, completes many big tasks.\nThus,\npromise easily made leads to promise not fulfilled;\ndifficulty underestimated leads to difficulty multiplied.\nThus, the sage, in treating every task as difficult, encounters no difficulties.",
        "64": "Governing is easy when there is peace;\nPlanning is easy when there is time;\nNipping is easy when buds are young;\nReconciling is easy when issues are minor.\nHandle matters before they come about;\nGovern people before there is chaos.\nA tree two-arms'-length wide grows from a seedling;\nA tower nine stories high starts with a spadeful;\nA journey a thousand miles long begins with a step.\nThe populace often fail when they are close to completing their tasks.\nBe as deliberate at the end as at the beginning; then, there can be no failure.\nThus, the sage desires what others do not desire, and places no premium on rare goods.\n[The sage] studies what others do not study,\nand revisits people's faults.\n[The sage] assists myriad matters to develop naturally but does not dare to interfere.",
        "65": "Men who knew Direction in olden days did not teach the populace to be clever, but teach them to be simple.\nA populace that is clever is difficult to govern.\nThus,\ngoverning with cleverness robs a state;\ngoverning not with cleverness benefits a state.\nOne who knows [the difference between] these two sets the standard.\nKnowing the standard at all times is Profoundest Virtue.\nProfoundest Virtue is deep; it is far.\nProfoundest Virtue returns matters to naturalness, to the Grand Gentleness.",
        "66": "The sea is the king to hundreds of streams.\nBecause it is good at lying low, it can be the king to hundreds of streams.\nThus, a sage,\ndesirous of being the populace's superior, must be obsequious to them;\ndesirous of being in front of the populace, must follow them.\nThus, a sage,\nsitting high, in no way burdens the populace;\nstanding in front, in no way harms the populace.\nThus, the world is happy to support [the sage] and is not tired of doing so.\nBecause [the sage] is not in competition, the people in the world cannot engage him/her in competition.",
        "67": "People in the world say that my Direction is grand as if without a referent.\nIt is because it is grand that Direction is without a referent.\nWere it capable of being referenced, it would not be grand.\nI have three treasures - embrace and safeguard them.\nOne, affection.\nTwo, restraint.\nThree, daring not to be at the front of [the people] of the world.\nWith affection, one becomes courageous;\nWith restraint, one becomes tolerant;\nDaring not to be at the front of the world, one is at the head.\nOne courts death if one\nforsakes affection for courage,\nforsakes restraint for tolerance,\nforsakes humility for prominence.\nWith affection,\nin war, one wins;\nin defense, strengthens.\nWhen cosmos comes to the rescue, it shields with affection.",
        "68": "One good at commandership does not easily use force,\none good at war is not easily provoked,\none good at winning does not easily engage in combat,\none good at deployment is obsequious.\nThis is the virtue of non-engagement; this is the ability at deployment.\nThis is fully consistent with the cosmos.",
        "69": "A saying among warriors:\nI dare not play host, I prefer playing guest;\nI dare not advance an inch, I prefer retreating a foot.\nThis is formless formation,\nthis is defenseless advancement,\nthis is oppositionless encounter,\nthis is weaponless display.\nNo disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy.\nUnderestimating the enemy verges on losing my treasures.\nThus, when two equal-size armies are in combat, the one that is grieved wins.",
        "70": "My words are easy to understand and easy to put into practice.\nBut no one in the world understands [my words], and no one puts them into practice.\nWords must be principled; actions must be justified.\nBecause these are not understood, I am not understood.\nWith few who understand me, fewer will put [my words] into practice.\nThus, a sage dresses simply but bears a jade.",
        "71": "Knowing that one does not know is best;\nNot knowing but pretending to know is a fault.\nA sage has no faults, because he/she is aware of his/her faults and works on these faults.\nBecause a sage is aware of faults and works on them, he/she has no faults.",
        "72": "When the populace is unafraid of threats, major threats loom.\nDo not harass their neighborhood;\nDo not interfere with their livelihood.\nThus, without interference, people will not interfere.\nThus, the sage knows self without self-touting, respects self without self-aggrandizement.\nThus,\nforsake self-touting and self-aggrandizement;\nembrace self-knowledge and self-respect.",
        "73": "Courageous in accepting dare results in demise;\ncourageous in declining dare results in survival.\nBetween these two, there are advantages and disadvantages.\nThe cosmos has dislikes, but no one knows the reason.\nIt is hard even for the sage to explain.\nThe Direction of the cosmos,\nthough does not compete, is good at winning;\nthough wordless, is good at responding;\nneeds no invitation and comes on own volition;\nand is at ease and is good at planning.\nThe cosmos's net is immense; it is loose but it does not miss.",
        "74": "When the populace are unafraid of death, what good is threatening them with death?\nWhen the populace are afraid to die, hold devious ones and put them to death.\nAfter that, who dares?\nThe official executioner is always there to do executions.\nDoing executions by anyone else is like felling trees by other than an arborist.\nA non-arborist, in felling trees, is unlikely not to hurt his hands.",
        "75": "Starvation in the populace is caused by excessive taxes.\nExcessive taxes result in starvation.\nDifficulty in governing the populace is caused by a governor's interferences.\nInterferences result in difficulties in governance.\nIndifference to death in the populace is caused by a governor's overindulgence.\nA governor's overindulgence results in the populace's indifference to death.\nOne who does not overindulgence is wiser than one who overvalues one's life.",
        "76": "At birth, one is soft and tender;\nat death, hard and stiff.\nAt the beginning, flora are tender and crisp;\nat the end, brittle and dry.\nThus, hardness and stiffness symbolize death; softness and tenderness, life.\nThus, an army, hard and stiff, is annihilated; a tree, hard and stiff, is cut.\nHard and stiff are inferior; soft and tender, superior.",
        "77": "The cosmos's Direction is like extending a bow.\nAiming too high, it lowers;\naiming too low, it raises.\nFrom the excessive, it takes;\nto the insufficient, it augments.\nThe cosmos's Direction is to take from the excessive and augment the insufficient.\nThis is not so for the direction in humans, which is to take from the insufficient to augment the excessive.\nWho is willing to augment [the insufficient of] the world with excesses?\nOnly ones with Direction.\nThus,\na sage provides without expecting approbation,\naccomplishes without seeking acclamation,\ndoes without flaunting wisdom.",
        "78": "In the world, nothing is softer and weaker than water, yet, in combating the strong, nothing can win over it.\nThere is nothing to replace it.\nThe weak wins over the strong; the tender wins over the steely.\nNo one in the world is unaware of it, yet no one follows it.\nThus, the sage says:\n\"One accepting a state's disgrace is worthy of being her governor;\none accepting the state's misfortunes is worthy of being the king to the world.\"\nRightful words appear paradoxical.",
        "79": "Settling a major enmity, residual enmity remains.\nResponding enmity with virtue - how can this be good?\nThus, the sage holds the left half [of a promissory block] but does not demand payment.\nOne with virtue acts like that creditor;\none without virtue acts like the tax collector.\nThe cosmos's Direction does not play favoritism.\nIt [simply] provides people with goodness all the time.",
        "80": "Small states.\nFew people.\nAll sorts of utensils, not in use.\nThe populace value death, unwilling to move.\nVehicles available, not in use.\nWeaponry available, not on display.\nTying knots for events.\nSuperbly governed.\nWell fed, beautifully clad, serenely housed, happily serenad'd.\nNeighboring states within sights.\nCrowing and barking heard across states.\nFrom birth to death, no interstate communication.",
        "81": "Sincere words are not pretty;\npretty words are not sincere.\nGood people are not argumentative;\nargumentative people are not good.\nLearned people are not erudite;\nerudite people are not learned.\nA sage does not hoard.\nThe more he/she provides, the more he/she is enriched;\nthe more he/she gives, the more he/she gains.\nThe cosmos's Direction is to facilitate and not harm;\nThe sage's Direction is to provide and not compete."
